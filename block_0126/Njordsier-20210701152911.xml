  <title>"*Sorry to Bother You* is satire for the moral compromises we make at our jobs, starting with the simple faux-civility of a salesman pushing a product on someone who doesn't need it."</title>

      <p>I thought <em>Sorry to Bother You</em> was pretty good as a piece of satire, even though I am much more pro-capitalism (or, to be more precise, pro-free markets) than the director of that movie.</p>
      <p>The intent of the horse people plot point was pretty clear to me: it's a literalized metaphor for corporations <em>dehumanizing</em> people. The protagonist, up to this point, had been making successively more egregious moral compromises in pursuit of climbing the corporate ladder. Each compromise was accepted by uncritically embracing corpspeak justifications and succumbing to social pressure from colleagues and bosses who appeared to sincerely believe those justifications. The absurdity of these compromises is partly played for laughs, but it's also a challenge to the audience to think about whether they make similar moral compromises to please their boss or their coworkers.</p>
      <p>The horse people represent the point where it boils over for the protagonist, where a line is crossed that he can't condone. Its absurdity is the point: the evil corporation he works for has led him to embrace complicity in moral compromises that far surpass what the audience would like to think they would accept. The movie, having made the protagonist complicit further, offers something truly, deliberately absurd to start the character and plot transition from the protagonist being complicit in the system to actively fighting against the system.</p>
      <p>The movie has the protagonist draw the line after something unthinkably absurd, and challenges the audience to ask themselves where <em>you</em> would draw the line and where you <em>should</em> draw the line. But it does more than that: it suggests that <em>society</em> draws the line even further: when the protagonist tries to tell the world what is happening, the evil corporation's stock value soars and politicians congratulate it for its innovation. Is this realistic? Probably not, but it is meant to appeal to a sense that society's moral compass is slower than your own, a sense that everyone knows that something about the system can be fundamentally broken and yet the elite seem to <em>revel</em> in this brokenness.</p>
      <p>This is what satire is <em>supposed</em> to do: amplify the absurdities of the familiar and use the shock and cognitive dissonance of the extreme result to critique those more mundane absurdities in our life. We don't literally live in Orwell's <em>1984</em>, but we feel the parallels from the novel to a sense of oppressive inability to speak the truth, a wariness of government surveillance, a gnawing distrust that your neighbors will side with you over the state, and a bitter cynicism that the public credulously believes whatever the media tells it. <em>Sorry to Bother You</em> is satire for the moral compromises we make at our jobs, starting with the simple faux-civility of a salesman pushing a product on someone who doesn't need it.</p>
