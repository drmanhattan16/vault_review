  <title>Why defend the past?</title>

    <div class="md">
      <blockquote>
        <p>Why are you so <em>defensive</em> about judging the past? </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This is an interesting question.</p>
      <p>My answer would be that the past is where <em>the present came from</em>. people made choices and lived with the consequences of those choices. This is an incredibly valuable thing. Applying current standards to the past is unfair, because one of the main reasons the present works is because we had the past to build on. Further, we have the present to judge the past by, but we do not have the future to judge the present by, and we understand (or think we understand) the past better than we do the present. If you like where you are now, you owe a debt to the people who got you here.</p>
      <p>The factors above seem to seriously undermine the idea of a simple comparison between the past and present, but people often extend their error further by comparing the past not to the present as it exists, but to some imagined alternate ideal. This seriously underrates another quality of the past: <em>it actually happened</em>.  If we're going to pretend that the results people were actually able to deliver are equivalent to the results other people are going to merely imagine, imagination will win every time, and will lead us all straight off a cliff.</p>
      <p>One can prefer the present to the past without losing sight of the idea that if the past had been otherwise, the present might be worse.</p>
