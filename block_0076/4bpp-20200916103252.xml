  <title>Powerlessness Begets Hatred</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>Are the two not two sides of the same coin? You don't just go around hating every little trivial problem you encounter; an emotion that intense is generally reserved for persistent and uniquely unpleasant obstacles. Progressives hate bigots because from their point of view, they are putting in all this work - campaigning, pumping out educational press articles, making special training programmes for children, putting up with tear gas and violent arrest, donating their hard-earned money to political campaigns - and the bigots still <em>won't go away</em>, or even are experiencing a renaissance (Trump, Brexit). If, with all your alleged privilege, you do everything you can and <em>still</em> don't get what you want, that's the definition of powerlessness.</p>
      <p>Powerlessness is what begets hatred. If you're multitasking kitchen utensils and a mosquito lands on your neck, you'll just shake your head to try and get rid of it. Only if you've done that ten times and it always just briefly flew up and landed right back on your head somewhere will you snap, drop a pot and slap it so hard that you wind up bruising your own face in the process. Yet, those two emotions have very disparate favourability ratings in our few remaining specks of shared moral calculus; that's why we impute only hatred to our opponents, and only powerlessness to our allies, even though the two almost always go hand in hand. (Just look at how positively <em>seething</em> our right-wing posters have been lately (inspired by <a href="/u/FCfromSSC">/u/FCfromSSC</a>'s confessional?), over everything ranging from <em>Cuties</em> to riots to abortion.)</p>
