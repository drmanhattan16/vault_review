  <title>Community-Building Tendencies Among Women</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>There are a lot of cultures -- including Western ones -- in which a large amount of "community building" traditionally falls on women. Examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The traditional "emotional labour" that women complain about, in which it is expected that women will do the work of remembering birthdays, buying Christmas gifts, and so on. "My mother-in-law complains that I am not making her son remember her birthday" is apparently still a real phenomenon for some people!</li>
        <li>I have a network of aunties who actually respond to my emails. I used to send bulk emails to my entire family, and sometimes I'd get responses from my father or an uncle, but the really long-form stuff was almost always from aunties. (Not my mother; she doesn't share this particular feminine trait because, well, intra-sex variation is real!) These days, I still send the occasional email out to them, because I know I'm likely to get a response.</li>
        <li>Not an anthropologist, but I saw a random post, once, about gift economies in which resources are shared through remembered social favours, and the right way for a man to obtain a resource may be for his wife to hint to another woman that you need this thing. Take with the requisite grain of salt.</li>
        <li>There are a lot of men in Western society whose primary social interactions are via their girlfriends, or who, like <a href="/u/iprayiam2">u/iprayiam2</a> below, mostly view certain types of social interactions as being mainly for the purpose of finding a girlfriend. There's also some (in my view, heartrending) social science on the way that break-ups often hit men harder, because they are less likely to have other sources of social support.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I definitely know men who also do this community building work. The apartment building in which I live has a number of men who organise events, sit on the Board of Directors, and so on.</p>
      <p>Still, I think the social media posts that you're seeing are likely to be extensions of this community-building tendency among women.</p>
      <p>I will also note that being pregnant, weirdly, made me more likely to participate, myself, in this type of behaviour. I responded more easily to invitations, and almost instinctively extended invitations of my own. I exchanged small gifts with my neighbours. Conversation felt more natural. I was less socially awkward! (How? How was I less socially awkward? I always thought it was about talent. I never realised it could be alleviated by just <em>naturally feeling the right things at the right times</em>. Super weird. I miss it a bit, now that I'm breastfeeding less and my brain chemistry is returning to what I would call normal.)</p>
      <p>I don't give the pregnancy anecdote to imply that men <em>can't</em> do community-building, to be clear. Nor do I think there is some sort of strict dividing line between social and biological effects. Lacking the pregnancy-related biological effects, I still see the value in keeping personal ties alive, and intend to continue doing so, as much as I'm able to. I agree with you that there are good reasons for men to do the same.</p>
