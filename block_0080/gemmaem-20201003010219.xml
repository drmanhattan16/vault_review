  <title>Trying To Watch US Covid Measures From the Outside</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>Watching from the outside, and trying to understand what America is going through, I've been somewhat influenced by Ed Yong's reporting in <em>The Atlantic</em>.</p>
      <p>One factor he identifies, when assessing the lockdown, is the way in which that time <em>wasn't</em> used to ramp up testing and contact tracing. From <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/09/coronavirus-american-failure/614191/">August</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>[E]veryday Americans did more than the White House. By voluntarily agreeing to months of social distancing, they bought the country time, at substantial cost to their financial and mental well-being. Their sacrifice came with an implicit social contract—that the government would use the valuable time to mobilize an extraordinary, energetic effort to suppress the virus, as did the likes of Germany and Singapore. But the government did not, to the bafflement of health experts. “There are instances in history where humanity has really moved mountains to defeat infectious diseases,” says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “It’s appalling that we in the U.S. have not summoned that energy around COVID‑19.”  </p>
        <p>Instead, the U.S. sleepwalked into the worst possible scenario: People suffered all the debilitating effects of a lockdown with few of the benefits.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>In <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/09/pandemic-intuition-nightmare-spiral-winter/616204/">a more recent article</a>, he accuses the US of "serial monogamy" with respect to pandemic solutions:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Stay-at-home orders dominated March. Masks were fiercely debated in April. Contact tracing took its turn in May. Ventilation is having its moment now. “It’s like we only have attention for only one thing at a time,” says Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida.  </p>
        <p>...  </p>
        <p>Other strategies have merit, but are wrongly dismissed for being imperfect. In July, Carl Bergstrom, an epidemiologist and a sociologist of science at the University of Washington, argued that colleges cannot reopen safely without <a href="http://ctbergstrom.com/publications/pdfs/2020CHEb.pdf">testing all students upon entry</a>. “The gotcha question I’ve handled most from reporters since is: This school did entry testing, so why did they get an outbreak?” he says. It’s because such testing is necessary for a safe reopening, but not sufficient. “If you do it and screw everything else up, you’ll still have a big outbreak,” Bergstrom adds.  </p>
        <p>...  </p>
        <p>Several experts I’ve talked with have been asked: What now? The question assumes that the pandemic lingers because the U.S. simply hasn’t found the right solution yet. In fact, it lingers because the familiar solutions were never fully implemented. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It's probably also true that lack of <em>spatial</em> consistency in solutions can be as bad as lack of <em>temporal</em> consistency. Applying more restrictions to areas with more outbreaks can make sense, but applying restrictions in a patchwork fashion across areas that are all dealing with similar threat levels probably undermines their usefulness considerably.</p>
      <p>Going back to the first article, this remark rang true about the varied successful approaches of different nations to containing the virus:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The countries that fared better against COVID‑19 didn’t follow a universal playbook. Many used masks widely; New Zealand didn’t. Many tested extensively; Japan didn’t. Many had science-minded leaders who acted early; Hong Kong didn’t—instead, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/05/how-hong-kong-beating-coronavirus/611524/">a grassroots movement compensated for a lax government</a>. Many were small islands; not large and continental Germany. Each nation succeeded because it <strong>did enough things right.</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Bold mine. As a resident of New Zealand, I might rephrase it a little and say that there's a long list of ways that nations either got it right or simply got lucky: social distancing, <em>early</em> lockdowns, testing &amp; contact tracing, mask use, border controls / being an island, and even just the sheer luck of having <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/09/k-overlooked-variable-driving-pandemic/616548/">fewer</a> "super-spreader" events. You don't need all of these, but you do seem to need a critical mass.</p>
      <p>Right now, New Zealand has been dealing with a couple of (to be clear, fairly small) renewed outbreaks (&lt;200 community cases total, with 8 community cases still active at time of writing) in precisely the way you recommend: looking at everything that seems to work, and trying to target measures that give more safety at less social/economic cost. Masks are pretty cheap, so we've been starting to use them a bit more. Testing capacity is high, and contact tracing has been as thorough as we can make it. Restricting large gatherings makes "super-spreading" less likely without cutting people off from each other. And so on.</p>
      <p>You guys are in a rough spot, because getting in early really does seem to be a major effectiveness multiplier, and that train has kind of left the station. You don't have a lot of central planning, which means efforts have been inefficient, which means people don't feel good about them and are less likely to pitch in. (Although I would like to give a shout out to the many, many Americans who I see pitching in at not inconsiderable personal cost, for all that).</p>
      <p>Still, I think your basic idea is sound. A narrative of "We've seen a lot more about what works and what doesn't, so it's time for some central planning to step in and co-ordinate the measures that will make the most difference" could do a lot for you guys, if you had anyone to make it to you. About which, uh, good luck?</p>
      <p>Really, though. Good luck.</p>
