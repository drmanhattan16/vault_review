      <p>Please don't mistake this for an effort-post. I can't do a deep dive on all of these topics. But broadly, from the charts linked below, I can't tell when the D's and the R's are in power. Therefore I raise my estimate that it hasn't mattered which party held the presidency. </p>
      <p>You can point to individual actions, like tax bills, stimulus packages, border control, etc. And certainly the executive office does impactful things. But asking the counterfactual question - whether the other party would have done a similar thing - is seldom investigated. Republicans can increase healthcare spending, and democrats can reduce immigration and corporate tax rates. Everyone can and has done everything. Are there even any trends?</p>
      <p>The charts below are just a quick google for major macroscopic metrics. The first chart I could find going back past the 90s (if I could). Apologies if any are too misleading or there's a much better source.<br />
Since 1989, the presidency goes RDRDR. So you should be looking for some kind of up-down-up-down-up (or inverse) pattern if you think partisanship has a big impact. For example, republicans are supposed to lower taxes. Democrats are supposed to increase healthcare coverage. But these lines are basically flat. Large jumps in lines don't correlate to partisanship, especially in the way we'd expect based on the party narratives.</p>
      <p>You can also ask the reverse question - we have so many quippy factoid statistics about percentages and numbers. Why don't we have one for presidency? "Health coverage goes down an average of 17% when a republican is president!". We don't have those talking points. Isn't that a red flag?</p>
      <p>So if you think the president matters, they must matter in a way that dodges literally all of these charts.</p>
      <p>(You could have some complicated theory about presidential effects being subtly smoothed, invisible over a 4-8 year horizon, but come on...)</p>
