  <title>How the body and mind change together, and how that relates to feminism</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>Feminism is a broad tent, and the rejection of cartesian dualism is a decidedly optional viewpoint within that broad tent. There are certainly feminists who have made, and do make, arguments of the "Treat people equally because it is the soul that is morally relevant" variety.</p>
      <p>I think the question you really meant to ask is, why do <em>I</em> reject cartesian dualism, and does that have anything to do with my feminist views or not?</p>
      <p>I don't really believe in the soul, but I do, of course, have a concept of the mind. That mind is, in my view, largely but not entirely driven by my brain; the "not entirely" is because I don't see the rest of my body as exempt! Indeed, I <em>am</em> my body just as much as I am my mind. I am not a ghost trapped in a machine; the demands of my body are not mere distortions on some sort of pure, rational mind that could exist apart from it. I am, in short, not a cartesian dualist.</p>
      <p>How did I come to this view? Well, for a start, I think better when I am using my left (that is, dominant) hand. Perhaps my hand is, then, also part of my mind? But, more deeply, I've been depressed; I've seen my worldview shift based on how much food I eat or how much sleep I get. I know that to heal the mind, you cannot ignore your body.</p>
      <p>You might say that the influence of the body on the mind is mere emotion, and that pure reason is separate from such things. Personally, I am not convinced of the existence of pure reason. Everything is at least a little bit subjective, even mathematics. Objectivity is valuable, and worth seeking, but it cannot be obtained in pure form.</p>
      <p>Circling back: is this feminist? Well, yeah, it is when <em>I</em> do it. I think, for example, that the reason/emotion dichotomy gains extra, unjustified emphasis based on the way we identify the former with masculinity and the latter with femininity. Certain things that might otherwise be "emotion" have historically been swept up into "reason" because they look masculine; certain things that might otherwise be "reason" have historically been swept up into "emotion" because they look feminine. The resulting societally-defined distinction has been used to assign a lower value to certain types of feminine concerns.</p>
      <p>My opposition to cartesian dualism has also been very much cemented by the experience of being pregnant. Pregnancy is a huge bodily change. It's honestly at least as big as puberty in certain respects; perhaps bigger. The mind is not separate from such changes. Why would it be? No, body and mind change together, because they aren't separate things.</p>
      <p>This was even more critical, for me, when giving birth. Birth is a largely but not entirely involuntary process. It is deeply influenced by the mind even as it is not controlled by the mind. I found it much easier to cope when I was able to let go of the idea that my body was doing something to me, and accept that I was my body, and I was doing something. I only wish the medical establishment was better able to understand the truth of such a view. That it does not is, I think, partly an artifact of the way modern obstetrics is founded in a worldview largely guided by men, who have not given birth and who routinely misunderstand -- in a variety of fascinating but horrible ways -- what birth can be like, subjectively.</p>
