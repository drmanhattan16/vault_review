  <title>Drawing Mohammed and the Power of Public Slights</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>I think a simpler explanation (than implying that all those Pakistanis are more afraid of being stomped by the boot of universal culture in the guise of French art cinema than in the guise of Chinese mobile phone games) is that drawing the prophet is first and foremost a slight to the honour of any Muslim, and as with any slight, the delivery, and what it asserts about the relative power and status of the sender and the recipient, matters. A slight muttered sheepishly and in secret achieves nothing much at all; a slight uttered confidently in public and not successfully challenged signals to the onlooker that the perpetrator is so strong that they can get away with it, and you are so weak that you can't do anything about it.</p>
      <p>The Chinese may be forcing Uyghur women to sleep with Han men and affirm that Xi Jinping is above God, but at least they are being circumspect about it and would clearly prefer if nobody outside of those immediately affected ever found out about it happening at all. Meanwhile, the French are posting their cartoons loudly and proudly and positively <em>daring</em> the Muslim world to come and do something about their <em>libert√©</em>.</p>
      <p>(Compare to the effect of Trump. At face/policy value, he is for sure far from the best thing that happened for the US right wing or the worst enemy of the US left wing, but he is the single loudest, crassest your-mother-is-a-whore graffito that anyone could have sprayed on the progressives' metaphorical car, and the members of both tribes feel the primal transfer of status in their bones even if they can't articulate it.)</p>
