  <title>It's Just a "Nuclear-Cannon-Sized" Black Powder Cannon, Officer</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>“Your honor, we can hem and haw all day about ‘How much black powder can go in a nuclear cannon before it’s just a ‘nuclear-cannon-sized’ black powder cannon’, but the fact remains that - while the cannon in-question is <em>capable</em> of firing an 850 lb W9 warhead 7 miles - it must be crew-served in order to be fired in such a manner! </p>
      <p>Whereas my client is a single individual, capable of only firing the gun via a laborious process involving several hours, the use of a crane, a series of tubes, 700lbs of black powder, a zippo lighter, and a plastic bottle of Ancient Age Fine Bourbon Whiskey.”</p>
      <p>“And furthermore, the <em>entirely unrelated</em> and <em>private</em> collection of W9 Nuclear Artillery Shells found in my client’s garage are themselves <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun-type_fission_weapon">gun-type fission weapons</a>, and as such should be completely legal to own! - if my client did indeed own them. However, they are owned by a series of trusts - the names of which are not to be spoken in polite company.”</p>
