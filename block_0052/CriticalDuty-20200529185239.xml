  <title>The Ultimate Success of China's Tiananmen Reaction</title>

      <blockquote>
        <p>Like the man said, those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I think part 1 of Moldbug's Open Letter juxtaposes this quote against Tiananmen Square, pointing out that the Chinese government "not only made peaceful revolution impossible, they made peaceful revolution violent". We are 30 years distant from Tiananmen Square now, and it is difficult to claim that from the perspective of securing the regime, the Chinese government made a mistake. They demonstrated quite convincingly that you can crush peaceful revolution and expand your power in 1989, and they demonstrated it again in Hong Kong this week. </p>
      <p>Revolutions are the product of one group of elites usurping another group of elites. Without foreign elites backing them up, the Hong Kong protesters quickly discovered that the Power of the People is just so much hot air.</p>
