  <title>Importing Woke Terms and Concepts From English</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>As an aside, sometimes it's great if English isn't your first language, because then, all of this stuff immediately stands out. </p>
      <p>In Dutch, there is no word for 'gender' as opposed to 'sex'. Of course not, why would there be one, the whole concept is new. The local woke then <em>imported the term from English along with the concept</em>. So now, when e.g. the (eternally salon-socialist) city council of Amsterdam puts out press releases, the English word "gender" stands out like a sore thumb from the otherwise Dutch sentences and it's completely obvious to everyone what's going on.</p>
      <p>In English, they redefine common terms. I'm not a native speaker, but sex and gender seem to have been synonyms up until very recently, so they are both accepted words. If you are not clued in, you literally can't tell what's going on. This way they can sneak in new concepts. Obviously, if you take the words from a different language, that doesn't work. It actually makes me wonder a bit why they don't try that over here. The woke almost never reuse Dutch terms or try to create any, they take the English, either directly or as a crude calque. They even do this when a natural-sounding Dutch translation is readily available. I don't know why they do that, but it seems like a tactical blunder to me.</p>
