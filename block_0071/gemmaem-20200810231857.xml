  <title>Questioning whether the West is Different</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <blockquote>
        <p>It's clear "the West" is different.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Is it?</p>
      <p>Like, yes, some people believe that Western ideas have some sort of special lock on freedom or truth or whatever. But I do think that's worth questioning. At the very least, there are definitely places where it is obvious to me that it's more complicated than that.</p>
      <p>For example, there are a lot of Eastern religions that are, at least hypothetically, much more tolerant of freethinking, and of alternate viewpoints. Buddhism, Confucianism and Taoism are all, arguably, philosophical schools as much as religions. They admit sub-viewpoints in which people follow particular teachers, and those sub-viewpoints need not be in conflict. Their claims to truth generally come down to "this person had some really wise ideas, look, see for yourself" rather than, say, "these writings are inspired by God and may not be questioned." In practice, of course, such philosophical religions can still admit intolerance; such is human nature. But their structure seems to allow for freethought in a way that Western religion often seems not to.</p>
      <p>For another example, I would argue that there are places where the Enlightenment tradition can make truth harder to see. I feel like Cartesian dualism is still warping all of our heads, making us believe that we're ghosts in machines instead of whole, entire, integrated people. We think of "body" and "mind" as separate when they're not, and it's really hard to stop, because that way of looking at things is just a fundamental part of how we're taught to understand ourselves from an early age.</p>
      <p>Cartesian dualism causes problems! Particularly in medicine. Like, we think of psychosomatic illnesses as being not "real" because they stem from the mind, and "real" illnesses stem from the body. But you can still die from a psychosomatic illness; it's real enough for that!</p>
      <p>Or, we sometimes think of the process of giving birth as an involuntary process that the woman is trapped in, because it's her body doing it, and her mind only has partial control. But if she's a whole person, and her body and mind are just intertwined aspects of that whole, then she doesn't have to be a mind trapped in a body that's doing something she can't control. She can be a whole person doing a thing that she wants to do, even if it's hard.</p>
      <p>So I think it's worth questioning the idea that "the West is different." Like, obviously, yes, cultures differ from one another, and Western cultures are less different to one another than they are to, say, Eastern cultures, but the idea that there's something particularly special about the West is worth questioning.</p>
