  <title>Feminism, Victim Blaming, and Reducing Abuse</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>There is a (now mostly discredited) strain of feminist thought that approaches it from a similar angle. The idea basically goes: men who try to control women are always acting in bad faith, here is a list of red flags that your man is controlling, if you're a proper feminist you won't stand for any of them and so you won't be abused. Thus, while of course we should sympathise with battered women, ultimately the cure is for these victims to become feminists and stop putting up with it.</p>
      <p>The main reason it's less common -- not un-heard-of, but less common -- to hear feminists talking that way, these days, is because there are multiple feminists who have come forward, bravely and often with great emotional difficulty, to say: "I thought I was strong. I thought I didn't have to worry about domestic violence because I was too smart for that. And so, when it did happen, I thought it couldn't be happening, and denied it to myself. Because I was a feminist, and because the narrative I was hearing from feminism made me too ashamed to acknowledge that it was even happening, let alone make it stop."</p>
      <p>Don't get me wrong, feminists still attack patriarchy for enabling abuse. And if you want to attack intersectional feminism for enabling abuse, well, this incident certainly gives you that opportunity. But you can -- and should -- do that without expressing contempt for victims. Because this sort of thing can always happen to people who think it could never happen to them.</p>
      <p>If I were someone who was frustrated by, as the saying goes, "the excesses of the social justice movement," and I wanted to make a political argument based on this particular incident of abuse, the argument that I would make is this one:</p>
      <p>
        <em>Sometimes, social justice rhetoric can end up trying make it impossible for people to push back on certain types of statements (e.g. telling men that they always have to defer to women on matters of feminism). This can hand a dangerous kind of unlimited power to the people who are allowed to make those statements (in this case, women). Even if, sometimes, "listen to women more often" is the correct heuristic, it's dangerous to try to turn that into an absolute, because all forms of power can enable abuse, even forms of power that stem from attempts at social justice.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If we don't want to risk trapping people in abusive situations, we can't lose sight of the need for people to be able to question everything they hear.</em>
      </p>
      <p>Would taking this critique on board make it impossible for anyone to ever be abused as a result of social justice rhetoric? Of course not, because that's a totally unrealistic standard. But it might push things in the right direction, both in terms of the potential for abuse, and also more broadly in terms of its impact on the broader social justice discourse.</p>
