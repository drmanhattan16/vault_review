  <title>What it means to lose an election, and why making that an existential question for anyone is a bad idea</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>I think the real question is....what does it mean to lose? </p>
      <p>I think the perception is that we've moved beyond talking about marginal tax rates and maybe debt obligations and the occasional social issue. I mean, I'm not going to lie, I'm Canadian, that's what losing means here, and I'm happy about that. </p>
      <p>But I feel in the US it's become something entirely different. It's become guillotines and death panels and confiscatory taxes, and revoking Trans people's right to exist and filtering money and status out of rural and semi-rural into urban environments and letting the world end because of climate change in 12 years, and using the threat of climate change impoverish the outgroup and enrich the ingroup and letting police run wild massacring black people and letting criminals run wild doing whatever the fuck they want. </p>
      <p>I tried to keep that as balanced as I could, if that wasn't obvious. </p>
      <p>That's why people are rioting. And it's why if Trump won, there absolutely would have been riots coming from the left. Politics has become existential. That's the issue. I think social media crackdowns certainly make it more, not less existential. Not the direction I want to move in. (It's possible creating firm rules that tackle it on a relatively non-partisan fashion and acknowledging previous unfairness and making a public commitment to tackle this going forward might make a difference positively)</p>
