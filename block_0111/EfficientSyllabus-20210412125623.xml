  <title>"Sure our state media in Hungary is way worse [than Germany's] in the other direction, but there at least nobody thinks it's independent."</title>

      <p>I find the German public TV news shows very patronizing in general.</p>
      <p>Generally everything is very cartoonishly simplified. Environment good, fighting climate change is crucial (yay Greta), nuclear is dangerous. Technocracy good, strong leadership bad. EU great (Freude, schöne Götterfunken), AfD is Nazi, Brexit insane, Trumpists crazy, solidarity great, "common European solution" is the jolly joker silver bullet (which just means big German corporate interest decides what happens), global cooperation, the condescending savior complex towards Eastern EU etc.</p>
      <p>I don't even mean these are all bad things. But the way it is presented is full of platitudes and is very binary: there are these clearly good things and everyone who disagrees just hates human rights and the rule of law. Even newscasters don't hide biases, they make faces and have this smug tone in their voice very often (like as if they think "I can't even believe such people exist"). I find it so strange that many Germans consider this unbiased and independent.</p>
      <p>Sure our state media in Hungary is way worse in the other direction, but there at least nobody thinks it's independent, it's so comically pro-right wing biased it's almost parody. People who like it, like it for being strongly pro-govt. and those who hate it hate it for the same.</p>
