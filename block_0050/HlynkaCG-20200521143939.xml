  <title>Hobbes, In Brief</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>Hobbes is weird, dense, and mostly wrote in Latin despite being a native English speaker. Likewise, a lot of his specific references and examples are going to go over your head if you aren't already familiar with the prominent figures and overall political situation of mid-17th century Europe.</p>
      <p>That said, if I had to synthesize and regurgitate his position (nice turn of phrase btw) it would be that the natural state of the world is violence, chaos, and entropy. That in order to have any hope of escaping that cycle, much less of building anything that might outlast you, one has to be willing to subordinate thier individual will to a higher authority <sup>1.</sup> I imagine Hobbes seeing Yarvin going on about the path of democracy being one of gradual societal decline and saying "Oh you sweet summer child, that's not democracy, that's just life. A world populated by psychotic murder hobos where nothing lasts longer than one individual's life-time <em>is the default</em>" Regardless of whether you agree with Hobbes on that point he did accurately identify/predict a bunch of the major issues and fault lines in secular humanism and basically derived from first principles, independent of one's specific religious beliefs, why Got Mit Uns (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyWt7t7PzE0">obligatory musical interlude</a>) was such a winning meme. No, he did not phrase it that way but you get the idea.</p>
      <p>Edit: footnote. I think this specific element of individual people both having free will <em>and</em> that will needing to be subordinate to something is the "secret sauce" that sets Hobbes and his philosophical descendants apart from other intellectual traditions.</p>
