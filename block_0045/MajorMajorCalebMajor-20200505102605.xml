  <title>Biological Theorycrafting in Rationalist Spheres</title>

        <p>The twitter user concludes that we should see the virus itself as being relatively harmless except for the immune system avalanche that it triggers; he says we should focus on stopping the avalanche instead of stopping the virus itself.</p>

      <p>Well yes, the entire medical community already knows that. ARDS is an immune mediated pathology. That's a well established fact. However we know generally that immune suppressive therapy doesn't really help that much. There's a lot of ongoing research (ie pre-COVID) into disrupting more specific immune mediators as treatment but no fruit yet.</p>
      <p>I don't really think there's much of use in that thread. It's the kind of biological theorycrafting which only very rarely translates to clinical medicine and is many more times likely than not to be outright wrong. This is one of the most frustrating things when medicine is discussed in rationalist spheres. There is a reason we rely so heavily on meta-analysis - because this kind of extrapolation from basic science knowledge just doesn't work 99% of the time and sometimes is actively harmful. The knowledge is incomplete, and the system is too complex on multiple layers to make definitive statements without real world data. </p>
      <p>His point about vaccine targets and core vs surface antigens is a good one, but something that vaccine labs generally consider when designing them as we've known about it for a long time.</p>
