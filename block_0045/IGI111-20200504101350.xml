  <title>4chan is a Pirate Ship</title>

      <p>That page is important memes, but you need to live it to understand them. </p>
      <p>I've said it before in this place so I'll say it again. 4chan is a pirate ship.
We all agreed captain mootykins was in charge because he was representing the will of the crew. And "there is no rule about moderation" so yes you'll get banned arbitrarily, because arbitrary reasons are the only reasons, rules are just guidelines to stay in his good graces.</p>
      <p>But should he start not representing the will of the crew he'll soon find out that the corollary is "there is no rule about posting". For all their best efforts jannies can't combat relentless autistic shitposting. They can't ban everyone and everything, and we are everyone and everything. So if we really want to talk about something we will. Because we all know who's really in charge here, and it's not the people who do it for free.</p>
      <p>This philosophy has been tested of course, sometimes moot held tyranny over anon. And that led to the exoduses, from the early one to 7chan caused by the infamous "/b/day" to the latest big one to 8chan that was essentially because discussion of GamerGate was getting deleted.</p>
      <p>Moderation crises are a common way for chans to branch out, 4chan was partly made because of one, and even smaller chans still follow this pattern, like arisuchan from lainchan for instance. Most chans are either made or become relevant because a bunch of anons wanted a new own place to shitpost with blackjack and hookers.</p>
      <p>Anon will shitpost about what needs to be shitposted about. And since CP and spam are a plague, jannies are a means to that end.</p>
