  <title>Improving Jury Trials By Isolating Jury Members</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>Jury trails would be vastly better if none of the 12 were allowed to talk to eachother.</p>
      <p>Simply vote. If 12 vote convict then done convicted, if there’s a holdout then Not Guilty. If there’s one holdout thats sufficient evidence the case wasn’t proven “beyond a shadow of a doubt” 1 out of 12 had actual doubts, not just shadows.</p>
      <p>All putting them together in a room does is allow bullies to extract unfaithful votes.</p>
      <p>Simply put if all 12 jurors were sufficiently intelligent and and principled then 11 strangers being grumpy with them wouldn’t change their vote, so why do we implement a system that only has an effect if it involves someone being unprincipled?</p>
      <p>The truth is the jury box functions to reverse the burden of proof. </p>
      <p>I’ve heard stories of Juries concluding both lawyers had bad arguments and poor evidence, so what did they do? They decided to informally retry the case right in the jury room and base the verdict on that! When “hey the prosecutor had bad arguments and bad evidence” should have immediately defaulted to not guilty! </p>
      <p>If they came to some conclusion that wasn’t discussed at trial and would be cursorily disproven by a piece of evidence the defence had but didn’t bring up because it wasn’t relevant, then not only have they convicted an innocent man in their Kangaroo court, but they’ve convicted in a manner that their argument can never be appealed! The defence can’t appeal against the misrepresented argument they just made up in the back room!</p>
