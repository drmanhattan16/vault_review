      <p>You joke about this, but some governments already do this. For example, the Province of British Columbia only owns one building, the Legislature. All the other buildings they "own" are actually held by a private corporation called British Columbia Building Corporation (BCBC), and the province pays rent and recieves a dividend from the company as its sole owner. The reason they do this? So they can remove trespassers, as public land has a much higher bar for removal than private land.</p>
