  <title>On the Rarity of Actual Witches</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>I would argue it's become increasingly clear that the "seven zillion witches problem" does not exist in practice simply because there aren't seven zillion witches. Sites like voat are cesspools because they are so small that seventy witches ruin them. However, larger sites don't have that issue because there are just not that many Actual Witches out there  (no, 4chan is not ruined by witches. Plenty of boards work just fine, and the problems in most are caused by tribal combat rather than witch infestation). Furthermore, any meritocratic group will not be overrun by them, for a reasonable definition of Actual Witch, because Actual Witches tend to be fairly ineffective and incompetent wignats. There is actually more merit in the world than there is witchcraft.</p>
