  <title>On the Inner Workings of Wikipedia</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>In Wikipedia, just like in real life, you have majority of people who are moderates and are following the rules, and a very vocal minority of activists. The reason the processes on Wikipedia have mostly worked so far is because of the way Wikipedia's governance is designed: it's much more direct than representative. It doesn't really have any elite, privileged class calling the shots that can be captured and used to steer it: there are administrators with some extra powers, but it is commonly understood that their powers are administrative, and that they can only use those powers on behalf of the will of the community. The admin privileges are effectively for life, and so you cannot hope to take over all seats. If your admin actions are not popular with community or are clearly overstepping the boundaries, other admins will just revert you, and you have no recourse, because there's no higher instance packed with your entryists.</p>
      <p>That's while the recent shenanigans with Wikimedia Foundation "anti harrassment" effort and the Framgate have reverberated so loudly in the community: the previously self-governing system suddenly got some weird shadow decision makers forced on it from the top. That's where the weak point was, and so that's where the entryist hit. That time, the assault has been repulsed, but we'll see more of that in the future.</p>
