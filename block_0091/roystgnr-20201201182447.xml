  <title>/u/roystgnr wonders whether the FDA could pass FDA approval</title>

      <blockquote>
        <p>How can the institutional culture of the FDA be changed to take this into account?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>By taking away their enforcement ability and leaving it as only a recommendation ability.  If a delay in allowing a good new drug means that your subjects must beseech you for your approval, that's status-raising.  If such a delay means that your subjects must learn to ignore your lack of approval, that's status-lowering.</p>
      <p>The incentives for delaying and disallowing bad new drugs would still exist, but would have some balance.</p>
      <p>This would be more consistent philosophically, too.  Was the FDA only empowered after a careful series of long studies, comparing FDA-enforcement and no-FDA-enforcement groups using a series of pre-specified quantifiable criteria, while simultaneously closely monitoring for any possible common or rare side effects?  No?  Approval denied, then.  If we wouldn't allow that kind of laxity for elective medical procedures, how arrogant must we be to allow it for mandatory ones?</p>
