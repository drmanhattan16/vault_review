  <title>Death Threats as Narrative Control</title>

        <p>I certainly donâ€™t think he deserves death threats</p>

      <p>If there is something that annoys me, it is how often "received online harassment / death threats" is used to either take control of a narrative back / build someone up as a victim or paint the opponents as evil people.</p>
      <p>Not that I think you are doing this, nor do I approve of anyone sending death threats, but I just notice how often they seemed to be used when a figure popular within the approved cultural zeitgeist is made to look bad, almost immediately the story becomes all about the torrent of abuse they are taking. So before you can criticize the person, you need to do a song and dance about how awful death threats are, etc. etc. which makes it much easier to make it look like your point is just nit picking, even have someone bother to read it, or look like you are beating on a fallen man. </p>
      <p>I'm sure Trump is given loads of abuse and death threats all the time, but popular culture doesn't really really care or concern themselves with apologetics before continuing to criticize him. Cancel culture is still a thing, and the popular culture doesn't wring their hands over what abuse they'll be given. All the death threats they'll receive. Because those people are the bad people, and they deserve it. It boils down to no bad tactics, only bad targets.</p>
