  <title>Your Irregular Reminder That You're In a Bubble</title>

        <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/170822/believe-creationist-view-human-origins.aspx">42% of Americans</a> believe in creationism. If we apply your standard, any discussion of biological evolution also is "partisan and inflammatory" despite its undeniable and easily accessible evidence.</p>
      <p>Would you uphold the same standards for discussions of evolution or paleontology? Must I preface with a careful citation of <em>The Origin of Species</em> any time we discuss dinosaurs or hunter-gathers? </p>
      <p>The only justification for one, but not the other, is to privilege the inflammation of leftists vis-a-vis rightists. I guarantee you that a far higher proportion of Americans are offended by evolution than crime statistics. It maybe only doesn't seem this way because most of us in this community (myself included) live in a blue tribe bubble. There's no Christian fundamentalist equivalent of Sneer Club who's whipping up Twitter mobs against us.</p>
