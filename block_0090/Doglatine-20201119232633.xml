  <title>The Black Tribe</title>

    <div class="md">
      <p>I could be way off, but my guess would be that most of the more vocal fans of Trump here don’t identify as grey tribe at all. Certainly the majority of grey tribe identified people I know (myself included) had a weak-moderate preference for Biden, with only some hardcore contrarian/libertarian grey tribers opting for Trump.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, I don’t feel we have all that many classic red tribers here. Most of the hardcore Trump supporters seem to be varieties of alt-right/Moldbug/Bronze Age Pervert-sympathisers. Maybe you want to call them grey tribe but honestly I think grey tribe is <em>their outgroup</em> - they think people like Scott are the gullible losers who just haven’t realised that classical liberalism is dead and we’re all fucked (unless...?). I guess I’d call them Black Tribe. They certainly don’t seem to neatly pattern match to conventional red tribe stereotypes, except maybe owning guns (how many people here actually go to church on a weekly basis?).</p>
      <p>None of this is intended as boo outgroup btw. Black tribers aren’t my outgroup, they’re my far group. I have to deal with Blue Tribe bullshit on a daily basis, filing reports on how my plans to hire a research associate will impact gender and racial diversity. Black tribers by contrast are a bunch of fascinating and usually pretty smart weirdos who I only ever encounter on the internet.</p>
