  <title>Tolerance is "making sure that even when things aren't exactly what we want, they don't bring the whole system down."</title>

      <p>What's your beef with tolerance?  It's pretty core to my beliefs, for the same reason that it's important in engineering: when you need holes for 1 inch bolts, the novice specifies a 1.000 inch hole, the apprentice specifies 1.000-1.010, the journeyman looks up the standard ANSI tolerance for a clearance hole, but the master just specifies the biggest hole that will work.  </p>
      <p>Tolerance creates slack, room to be wrong, room to adjust, and lets us be less than perfect.  Tolerance is the gap between what we want and what we are forced to destroy.  It's making sure that even when things aren't exactly what we want, they don't bring the whole system down.</p>
