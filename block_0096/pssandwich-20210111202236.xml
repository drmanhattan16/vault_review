  <title>Randall Munroe's popular "free speech" comic being undermined by its own alt-text</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>I'm going to go off on a slight tangent here since you brought up the XKCD free speech comic.</p>
      <p>I've seen a lot of discussion about this comic, but one thing that is seldom discussed is the alt text, which reads</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>I can't remember where I heard this, but someone once said that defending a position by citing free speech is sort of the ultimate concession; you're saying that the most compelling thing you can say for your position is that it's not literally illegal to express.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>What strikes me as interesting about this alt text is that people who hold Randall Munroe's opinions about free speech never stop to think about the contrapositive of this statement, which is "if person A's only positive comment about X is that people have a right to say X, it is likely that person A does not believe X." </p>
      <p>I think this is important because people who are against free speech like to conflate "argument for idea X" and "defense of the right to advance idea X", and I view this alt-text as an accidental admission that those are different things.</p>
