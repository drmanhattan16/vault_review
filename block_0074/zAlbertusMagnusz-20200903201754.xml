  <title>Political Clothing as Bonding</title>

      <p>My favorite diner (it's .35mi from where I live) sells BLM lager by the 6-pak and has little cutouts for it on every other table. </p>
      <p>Everywhere we go, we're told what other people think, how they feel, people making all sorts of statements about everything. Personally, I enjoy wearing Hawaiian shirts and shirts with movie logos on them. Currently i'm wearing a Jugger T from The Blood of Heroes, a fantastic and campy 80's flick starring Rudger Hauer (bad spelling aside). </p>
      <p>One time at Costco I was wearing my I Spit on Your Grave T and some guy commented on it and we talked about horror films from his childhood. It was a very much better way to spend time in line.</p>
      <p>Every person wearing a Trump hat or Trump mask or US flag shirt that I've pointed to and said 'nice shirt' or something, has absolutely beamed with joy that someone was talking to them about their favorite thing. I imagine, but can't know, that if I had made the same interactions when HOPE and Change shirts and hats were ALMOST as plentiful, I would have gotten similar vibes. Alas, I was what I would describe as a Jon Stewart Liberal until 6 years ago so I had nothing to say about politics. </p>
      <p>I'm thinking the boaters just love America, love Trump, hate the make believe liberals in their heads, hate the real liberals on CNN, and just want to chat with other people that feel the same.</p>
      <p>Ever watch the I Spit on Your Grave remake and sequels ?</p>
