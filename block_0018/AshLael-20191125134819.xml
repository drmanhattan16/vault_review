  <title>It's Ok to Be You</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>I’m going to contrast here the respective reactions to “It’s ok to be white” and “Black lives matter”.</p>
      <p>Both of these statements make a plain, unobjectionable claim. Both smuggle in an assumption that the Bad Guys disagree with the plain, unobjectionable claim.</p>
      <p>The counter to “Black Lives Matter” was “All Lives Matter”. The counter to “It’s OK to be White” is “You can’t say that, racist!”</p>
      <p>Imagine for a moment that the reactions were reversed. Imagine if “It’s OK to be White” were counter-memed with “It’s OK to be You”. I think that would be an effective response that would kill the power of the original statement.</p>
      <p>And imagine that the response to “Black Lives Matter” were to tear down any poster that said it and shame any person who spoke it. I think that would make the message of “Black Lives Matter” all the more pressing and urgent and powerful.</p>
      <p>Do you still think that you are combatting white supremacism by pulling down these posters?</p>
