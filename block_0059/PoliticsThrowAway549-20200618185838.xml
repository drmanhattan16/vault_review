        <del>I am of the opinion that</del> the reduced character count eliminates nuance and makes everyone sound <del>more</del> confident <del>than they might otherwise feel</del>.  <del>Most</del> ways to couch weak opinions take up too many characters, and so they're <del>probably</del> the first to go.  This is double-edged: people you <del>mostly</del> like with sound authoritative, while people you <del>may slightly</del> disagree with sound irrationally confident in their <del>arguments for what you may consider to be</del> evil.</p>
