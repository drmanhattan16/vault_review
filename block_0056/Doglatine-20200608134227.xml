        <em>”Hey Grandad, could you help me with my history homework? I have to write an essay about the causes of the Second American Civil War. You were alive, then, right? What do you think caused it?”</em>

        <em>”I certainly was. Hells, I fought in it. I served two years in the trenches in Virginia, and another year on the Colorado front after they dropped the bomb on Denver. And I was one of the first of the troops who landed on Brighton Beach when we tried to take Brooklyn. But the causes... that’s complicated. Let me ask you, have you ever heard of a woman named Zoe Quinn?”</em>
