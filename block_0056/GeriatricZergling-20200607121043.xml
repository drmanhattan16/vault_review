  <title>Cat Facts! Speed and Preflexes</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>Because they're unfamiliar with the terrain and don't know what they're stepping on or where.  At top speeds, smaller mammals can have stance phases (when the foot us on the ground) of 200 ms or less, and reflex actions can take 50-100 ms, meaning by the time you react, you're already halfway through your stride.  Vision helps, but doesn't give all the information, like traction and compliance. They have "preflexes", non-neural control with near instantaneous response times based on inherent muscle and tendon properties, but those are limited in what you can recover from.  By and large, most limbed animals slow down over uneven and especially unknown terrain.</p>
