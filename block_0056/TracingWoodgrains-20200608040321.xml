  <title>Bridging the Inferential Gap: Why TradCons Dislike Consent Culture</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <blockquote>
        <p>The fact that there is such a set of rules doesn't mean that promiscuity is a norm. Perhaps it means that the culture doesn't view it as abnormal either. And I'm sure it's contrary to some tradcons desires to have a culture that doesn't explicitly stigmatize it. </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I have a story that might help bridge the inferential gap here a bit, one from a while back when I was still a practicing Mormon. </p>
      <p>We had a mandatory "consent"... I almost want to call it a rally... at my school. Brought in some overexcited speaker, ready with all sorts of stories and mediocre jokesâ€”you know the drill. It sticks around in my memory as one of the most weirdly uncomfortable "you don't belong" experiences of my life.</p>
      <p>Why? Well, the scene: Up on stage, this guy talking about all sorts of norms around hookups at parties or bars, particularly with drinking, emphasizing how sex is fun and everyone does it and it's not a big deal, but make sure you consent. Down in the audience, me, a devout Mormon who would have been horrified by the idea of any sort of nonconsensual sexual encounter, but who was also about as removed as someone can be from a culture of casual, no-strings-attached sex, who was deeply uncomfortable with everything connected to hookup culture. Even the idea that I would ever be attending that sort of party was alien and unnerving.</p>
      <p>As someone with a minority moral stance, at some point you get used to the message that it is not yours to enforce on others: that you follow it, and you take it seriously, but you don't go barging in and, say, tell a bunch of people to quit swearing, give them the side-eye when you hear they hooked up, or lecture your friends on the evils of R-rated movies. There's a sort of truce in place, and secular culture knows to laugh at and shut down religious people who break that truce. </p>
      <p>For me, the best way I can describe my tangled impression at the time is something like (using strong wording for effect): "Look. I <em>have</em> moral rules, and they're a whole lot stricter than the ones you're shoving at me. There are people in my life who didn't even <em>kiss</em> until they got married. You don't have the slightest clue about my cultural norms; you're just trampling in acting as if everyone's living in the messy world you're living in. Why are <em>you</em> the one lecturing <em>me</em> about your alien, half-hearted morality?"</p>
      <p>The message of consent isn't wrong or immoral. But I agree that the way it's presented treats hookup culture as a given, and for someone outside of hookup culture it comes across as a bizarre and unnecessary imposition of a hostile set of norms. It's like a bizarro-world repackaging of the feeling a modern secular humanist gets hearing lectures about chastity at Catholic school. </p>
      <p>
        <a href="/u/SayingAndUnsaying">/u/SayingAndUnsaying</a> can confirm whether or not that feeling aligns with his own experience. No longer having a comfortable, distinct culture to stick with, I wouldn't have the same experience at something like that any longer, only flashes of residual irritation and a bit of yearning for something less... I don't know, unserious. But I get what he means when he describes it as an expectation of promiscuity. It mirrors my own experience with it.</p>
