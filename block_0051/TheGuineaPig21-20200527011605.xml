  <title>What if Hitler Died in 1939?</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>If Hitler had died, or perhaps better for this hypothetical removed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oster_conspiracy">Oster conspiracy</a> I think it's hard to say exactly what would've happened. The German economy was already in dire straits by 1939 and there were very strong institutional forces shaping its drive eastward, so it is very possible that Germany would've invaded Poland in '39/40 regardless (though how the Allies would've reacted is then another question).</p>
      <p>However the thrust of your question is probably whether or not Stalin was planning to move westward from the Secret Protocol borders; to which the answer is unquestionably <em>yes</em>. The Soviet Union was very vulnerable in 1940-41 as it was reorganizing and rearming, but there is a very large amount of evidence that Stalin was planning for westward invasions in 1943-44. I'm mostly drawing this from <em>Stumbling Colossus</em> by Glantz, but Stalin was very aware of the dire state of the Soviet armed forces in 1941. That Germany was at war with the Western Allies is part of what made him comfortable with the wait (and also why he was so blind to the ultimate German attack).</p>
      <p>Where German/Soviet interests collided was in particular Romania, the key German ally and the source of almost all of Germany's oil. German's junker military caste also particularly desired the Baltic for historic reasons, as well as Ukraine for its agricultural potential. A German/Soviet confrontation was inevitable, and all the major figures more or less said as much (in private).</p>
