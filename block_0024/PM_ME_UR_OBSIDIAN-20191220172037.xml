  <title>The Many Facets of "Culture" - American's Blind Spots</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>I think the Americans I've spoken to in general seem to have a very limited perspective of culture. Culture is shared values, it's modes of communication, modes of familial organization. Some stuff that is the norm in America would be unthinkable elsewhere, and vice versa.</p>
      <p>I hypothesize that Americans are worse at this because other Westerners have all witnessed at least two cultures: their own local culture, and American hegemonic culture. So they have a sort of basis upon which to extrapolate what culture can be. But Americans only have access to American hegemonic culture, which is relatively uniform. So their understanding of culture is usually limited to signifiers like food and dress.</p>
      <p>A tangentially related theory is that, much like geographic barriers are necessary for ecosystems to differentiate, language barriers are necessary for cultures to differentiate. If I am right, English Canada, UK and Australia would also be uniquely bad at figuring out the "meaning" of culture, because the two cultures they are exposed to - local and hegemonic - are necessarily very similar by virtue of a high meme flow.</p>
      <p>This is why the Québécois value French so much. Mass media must be translated to French in order to impact the Québécois culture. This is a significant handicap that limits meme flow and protects the distinct Québécois identity.</p>
