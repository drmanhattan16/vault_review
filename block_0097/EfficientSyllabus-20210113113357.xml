  <title>Compartmentalizing your life is good for you and for society</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>It's not that you can't do activism at all, just not while at work. Work time is for work, not unrelated things. If you're buddies with some coworkers you can grab a beer or coffee after work and chat as much politics as you want.</p>
      <p>There's no reason to bring up current events if they have no bearing on the work. If you are traumatized by the news and cannot work, get evaluated by a doctor and give their certificate to your boss.</p>
      <p>I feel like this already starts at school and college in America. Every aspect of life is merged under one institution and people don't learn that different spaces/spheres are for different things. Like blending sports and extracurriculars into university, having university tribunals for rape cases instead of handing it over to state institutions, evaluating applicants on irrelevant things under "well roundedness" etc. Then you go on to a job and your health insurance depends on them, etc, tech workers are coddled with free food and entertainment, the company even calls the workplace a campus to remind employees of college.</p>
      <p>The idea of this all encompassing space is harmful precisely for reasons like this.</p>
      <p>Coworkers aren't your buddies by default, be professional. Send your memes and hot takes on recent events to your friends' WhatsApp or Facebook group or whatever.</p>
