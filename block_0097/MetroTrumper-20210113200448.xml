  <title>Calibrating priors on the career trajectory of people who bomb the U.S. Senate</title>

      <p>I'll leave this other event as a sibling comment to my other. It's rather before the timeframe of big tech, but still:</p>
      <p>Read up on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susan_Rosenberg">Susan Rosenberg</a>. She had a hand in several bombing attacks, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_United_States_Senate_bombing">1983 United States Senate bombing</a> which seemed to have an intent to assassinate multiple US Senators. She received an IMO appropriately long prison sentence for crimes in connection with this and other bombings. Then-President Bill Clinton commuted her sentence in 2001. She now has a high-ranking position in the Black Lives Matter Global Network.</p>
      <p>It seems that, if you have the right politics, you can actually bomb the US Senate, get pardoned, and get a highly-paid position in a movement that's deemed Correct, approved by everybody, and if you ever question it publicly, you will be destroyed.</p>
      <p>Bringing it back to big tech and social media, I don't think she has a Twitter account, but <a href="https://twitter.com/WilliamAyers">Bill Ayers does</a>, and he had a piece of that and other bombings.</p>
