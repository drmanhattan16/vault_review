  <title>The Internet as A Mirror</title>
  <context>
    <p>This could go as a tag-on to KulakRevolt's post on the Internet, but I think it's just interesting enough to be its own top-level. Be warned the article has a particular tone that can be grating, but even so it's worth a skim</p>
    <p><a href="https://theoutline.com/post/8161/x-is-just-y-for-z?zd=1&amp;zi=suf2x3c5">THIS ESSAY IS JUST HARRY POTTER FOR PEOPLE WHO THINK COMPARING THINGS TO HARRY POTTER IS STUPID</a></p>
    <p>Personally I think the <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GoneHorriblyRight">Gone Horribly Right</a> interpretation of the Internet is accurate; we did get access to all the world's knowledge, and now we know that most of that knowledge is utter twaddle that we use for personal validation or social one-upmanship.</p>

      <p>You see I think this is why I like the Internet as it developed and I think it delivered on its promise:</p>
      <p>I really enjoy things that do what they do perfectly and literally, such that they turn into a kind-of Monkey’s Paw and ultimate judge if their users character.</p>
      <p>Power tools, Kitchen tools, cars, GUNS. There’s something special about them that they do their job whether or not its a good idea in this particular instance or whether or not the user isn’t a idiot who should have realized they shouldn’t trust themselves with it.</p>
      <p>You put a gun or car or chainsaw in some peoples hands and they reveal a maturity or capability beyond themselves and some reveal an utter lack of character.</p>
      <p>The internet has really functioned in this mirror-like way: in some people it revealed incredible creativity, whimsy, curiosity and judgement.... and in others it revealed their neuroses, cruelty, pettiness and vices.</p>
      <p>I mean if you look at the internet and you hate it...well you are really looking at yourself.</p>
