  <title>Do People care About Freedom?</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>If you mean specifically at this level of technology and this point in time, you're right. But I don't think many people care about rights qua rights. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"Look, giving you the vote was an interesting experiment, but it hasn't worked, so let's go back to you having no power. You'll be happier that way, really." </p>

      <p>Yeah, they know it failed before so they wouldn't give it another try. Too bad people won't take this same attitude towards communism, but I'm digressing. If (and that's a huge whopping <em>if</em>) they had reason to think "this time we'll get it right," then yeah, I think a lot of people would be fine with that. Bread and circuses!</p>
      <p>If, a couple decades hence, AGI happens and, say, takes over Canada, and post-scarcity AGI-Canada throws open its doors to anyone that wants to come in: "You'll want for nothing, you will have infinite entertainment at your fingertips, but you'll have no vote in the running of the country," I suspect that will be an extremely popular offer. This would be a <em>general</em> disenfranchisement rather than a specific one, and perhaps that's a useful distinction to be made. But I think a majority of people (regardless of race/color/sex/gender/etc) would rather be stable, well-fed, and politically powerless, rather than <em>technically</em> having a vote but still being, generally, screwed.</p>
