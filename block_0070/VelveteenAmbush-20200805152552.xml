      <p>As the lucky first participant in <a href="/u/Doglatine">/u/Doglatine</a>'s new <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/i2r8qo/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_august_03_2020/g085tr8/">User Viewpoint Focus Series</a>, here are my answers to the eight questions posed. I feel pretty self conscious posting about myself, and really I agreed to do this rather than seeking it out, so I can't promise that I'm prepared to defend everything I've said or respond to every response. As suggested by <a href="/u/Darwin2500">/u/Darwin2500</a>, I'll post my responses to the eight questions as individual replies to this comment.</p>
      <p>(Also Doglatine pointed out that I accidentally posted this in the old CW thread last night, so I'm copy pasting it here. Apologies to those who are getting pinged twice.)</p>
      <p>For the next entry, I nominate <a href="/u/stucchio">/u/stucchio</a> to post his responses in next week's thread and nominate the next participant. It seems I have the option to swap out one of the eight question for another, but I am not going to exercise it because I don't have any better ideas.</p>
