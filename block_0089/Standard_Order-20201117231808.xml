  <title>Has Egalitarianism Gone Too Far?</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>This kind of thing bothers me for a very different reason than it did a few years ago.</p>
      <p>Before the alt right ate the manosphere, in the era captured by <a href="http://theredpillmovie.com/"><em>The Red Pill</em> documentary,</a> I thought this was a gross violation of egalitarianism. If men and women are equal, what's with the gross double-standard?</p>
      <p>Now, I look at this and think, of course. "Women and children first" isn't an outdated artefact of a patriarchal age, it's the natural order of things. News headlines are a symptom of this: crimes against women drive more clicks, because regardless of what egalitarian delusions we live under, people retain an instinctive understanding of what matters. Fighting that nature is dumb and impossible.</p>
      <p>The societal problem isn't that the push for egalitarianism hasn't succeeded, it's that it's succeeded too far, creating the modern paradigm where women receive both the biologically-necessary preferential treatment of their gender and the egalitarianism-mandated privileges of egalitarianism. This is long-run unstable, and cracks are already appearing in the edifice: rapidly rising rates of both childless women at middle age and antidepressant prescriptions.</p>
      <p>I doubt the paradigm will survive this century, or even this half-century. But even if it falls, "Women most affected" headlines seem unlikely to disappear with it. Sorry!</p>
