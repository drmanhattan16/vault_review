  <title>The Desire for Freedom as Recognition</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>Isaiah Berlin in his essay <a href="https://cactus.dixie.edu/green/B_Readings/I_Berlin%20Two%20Concpets%20of%20Liberty.pdf">Two Concepts of Liberty</a> criticises what he calls "the search for status" in a chapter by the same name. At certain times when men complain about their lack of freedom they:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"<em>may be seeking not for what Mill would wish me to seek, namely security from coercion, arbitrary arrest, tyranny, deprivation of certain opportunities of action, or for room within which I am legally accountable to no one for my movements. Equally, I may not be seeking for a rational plan of social life, or the self-perfection of a dispassionate sage."</em></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Rather than what we might call these more traditional demands for liberty, Berlin claims that:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>"What oppressed classes or nationalities, as a rule, demand is neither simply unhampered liberty of action for their members, nor, above everything, equality of social or economic opportunity, still less assignment of a place in a frictionless, organic state devised by the rational lawgiver. What they want, as often as not, is simply recognition (of their class or nation, or colour or race) as an independent source of human activity, as an entity with a will of its own, intending to act in accordance with it (whether it is good or legitimate, or not), and not to be ruled, educated, guided, with however light a hand, as being not quite fully human, and therefore not quite fully free."</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Importantly, these demands are often important enough that liberty in its other senses will be worth sacrificing for its achievement:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <em>Although I may not get `negative' liberty at the hands of the members of my own society, yet they are members of my own group; they understand me, as I understand them; and this understanding creates within me the sense of being somebody in the world. It is this desire for reciprocal recognition that leads the most authoritarian democracies to be, at times, consciously preferred by its members to the most enlightened oligarchies, or sometimes causes a member of some newly liberated Asian or African state to complain less today, when he is rudely treated by members of his own race or nation, than when he was governed by some cautious, just, gentle, well meaning administrator from outside.</em>
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Berlin saw this as an important concept for understanding the motivations of people who speak sincerely of enjoying more freedom while objectively suffering more deprivations of their rights than they did under the old regime, but he kept to the belief that it was a result of the confusion of liberty with other concepts like equality and fraternity.</p>
      <p>***</p>
      <p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/jdvqk5/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_october_19/g9rm4t9?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">few weeks back</a> I raised the question of whether the progressive strategy of normalisation might be in response to the feeling that their liberty is ultimately only guaranteed by the tolerance of the majority, and that this position is intolerable to many. Of course they have many complaints about their treatment in the here and now, but bracket that off and there remains another serious fear that the gains they have made are precariously held and so they must be on watch for anything that threatens to look like an outpouring of intolerance.</p>
      <p>The key idea here is that being dependent on the will of another group or person is to be a slave, no matter how much liberty they may grant you (a well treated slave is still a slave). This the the neo-Roman or Republican form of liberty, the names coined by Quentin Skinner and Philip Petit respectively, the idea that "liberty is not merely the enjoyment of a sphere of non-interference but the enjoyment of certain conditions in which such non-interference is guaranteed" <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberty-positive-negative/#RepLib">(SEP)</a>, or as Skinner puts it in his essay <em>A Third Concept of Liberty:</em></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The distinctive claim they defend is that a mere awareness of living in dependence on the goodwill of others serves in itself to restrict our options and thereby limits our liberty. The effect is to dispose us to make and avoid certain choices, and is thus to place clear constraints on our freedom of action, even though our rulers may never interfere with our activities or even show the least sign of threatening to interfere with them.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The "cultural and economic strongholds" mentioned in your quote seem like a desire for a greater degree of this kind of independence, and nationalism is just a further movement along that spectrum (Skinner clearly shares the idea that nationhood can be a means for Republican freedom as he cites the American Revolution as an example of this ideal).</p>
      <p>As to why progressives tend to monopolise this discourse, their program promises an increase in the share of power the black community has in the institutions that dominate them. The right does have a counteroffer of making those institutions less dominant in the first place and securing more autonomy for more local communities but it's a hard sell because (i) the black community in America doesn't have much of a historical experience of this strategy working out for them (ii) it's doubtful that the right could even deliver on this promise these days, while the progressives are delivering on theirs right now.</p>
