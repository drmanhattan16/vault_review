        <p>There must be some purpose though, in the Chestertonian sense, to it all.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>There's a value to rituals for their own sake.  They create a sense of shared continuity and community, shared across distance and time.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>All it encouraged me to do is disbelieve in the other fairy tales my parents had told me (mainly Jesus, but Noah and the ark, Jonah and the whale as well). </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I consider this one of the values of the tradition.  My children will figure out that magic isn't real and that sanity and rationality win where wishes and blind hope fail.  But that shock is ameliorated by the realization that the <em>experience</em> of the magic was real, because their parents loved them enough to put on an elaborate ruse for the fun of it.</p>
      <p>It's like a reverse of that Pratchett line about people needing the little lies to prepare them for the big lies.  Children need the experience of breaking through little illusions to prepare them to overcome the serious ones.</p>
      <p>Also, my kids are currently in the phase where they've figured it out, but they're not certain I won't stop doing presents if they let on that they know.  So they try to "subtly" sound me out on the topic, and I pretend that I don't notice.  It's hilarious and adorable, and may be useful training for hiding the consequences of future red/black pills.</p>
