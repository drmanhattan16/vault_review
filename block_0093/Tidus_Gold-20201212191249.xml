        <strong>What do vegans, pro-life activists, and abolitionists have in common?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>It’s always interesting to try to get into the perspectives of people with radically different beliefs, looking to the past is usually the best way to do this. For example what does it feel like to think like Thomas Hobbes and count <a href="https://atlas-disciplines.unige.ch/Images/Source_images/Hobbes_Thomas_1651_Leviathan_part_1_chap_IX_p_65.jpg">astrology</a> as a valid means obtaining knowledge about the world on par with the other sciences? There’s no feeling of being “radically incorrect”, at least not until someone has proven to you that this is the case, and so the perspective from which astrology can slot into the worldview of an otherwise scientific and learned mind and not ring any alarm bells remains a strange one. We can try to imagine what it would be like but it’s hard to feel so viscerally superstitious, the phenomenological experience is shut off to us and we can at best try to find analogies.</p>
      <p>Back in 2018 in the leadup to the abortion referendum in Ireland I found myself spending a lot of time defending the pro-life position from the worst of the strawmanning as I felt that while the pro-choice position was a very convincing one it was still valuable that people know the actual arguments of the position they were voting against. I won’t go into the arguments for and against here, but it didn’t take long to notice the futility of this exercise as after each lengthy thread of argumentation it came to seem like for both sides the difference was not based in any one argument but on a choice to either extend or not extend empathy this extra step (being empathetic has positive connotations but it can obviously still be mistaken or absurd to do so, so this isn’t an attempt to claim the moral high ground for either side.) It was very hard to get someone to lay out the conditions under which they would change their mind and commit to this as any time those conditions were matched by an argument they would simply realise that those weren’t the central reasons for them believing what they did. The philosopher who can shift their deepest convictions with ease in the face of a rational argument is a rare one.</p>
      <p>In the same manner, vegan activists tend to have an answer to any conditions that non-vegans claim can’t be met by animals: <em>We feel pain and they are just automatons? Of course they feel pain. We have an inner life. How do you know animals don’t? We are capable of rational thinking and they aren’t. Are you saying the seriously mentally impaired aren’t human??</em> This isn’t to say that the questions of abortion and veganism can’t be resolved by a sufficiently compelling rational argument, but this is very hard to do when it’s difficult to even find common ground on what constitutes a compelling moral fact. Vegans and pro-life activists face a common issue, aside from the rational case they must make they also must find a way of engaging people’s empathy. It’s clear that they themselves recognise this fact from the propensity to share shocking imagery they both have, though they might not recognise their similarity with one another on this point.</p>
      <p>So what does this teach us about history? Well what is a problem that vegans, pro-life activists, and abolitionists have in common? That they have to successfully extend people’s empathy to include another category of person to get anywhere. This is most clear with the abolitionists who no one would doubt had every point of rationality in their favour but nevertheless spent a long time shouting from the rooftops about an absolute evil that most of society didn’t care enough to do anything about. (Before going further I have to again stress that this isn’t an argument in favour of extending empathy in general and that veganism and the pro-life position could still end up being totally wrong.)</p>
      <p>And the darker flipside of this, what is the phenomenological experience of being a slave owner? To not take seriously the people telling you that what you are doing is an absolute evil, to not be willing to extend empathy to another category of person, even (as was clearly the case with slavery, but is still up for debate with the other two) when rational argumentation is against you, to do so with a clean conscience because extending empathy somewhere it doesn't belong it simply absurd. Feelings that the vast majority of us share word for word with regard to either animals or the unborn. The venn diagram of pro-life activists and vegan activists has so little overlap that most people are going to be able to know what this feels like with regard to one of the two, and that should teach you something about what it felt like for slave-owners and genocidal conquerors.</p>
      <p>It’s hard to try and imagine the perspective of what going along with total dehumanisation feels like because when looking at the historical examples in the back of our heads we know that of course those people were humans who had all the rights of other people. Hopefully bringing it up in contexts where being pro-dehumanisation is currently the majority (and possibly correct) opinion in today's society can teach us about what it felt like when past societies felt this way about categories of people we now accept uncontroversially (e.g the foreigner, the slave, the unwanted infant). This isn't an argument in favour of veganism or the pro-life position, it's an attempt to get into the heads of some strange and often evil characters in history.</p>
      <p>There does seem to be something unsettling about describing the mind of an evil person in a way we can relate to so easily, as if an evil person's mind should be full of disgusting and foreign thoughts. But most evil people in history thought they were doing something good or at least acceptable, and so the phenomenological experience of doing evil should for the most part be indistinguishable from doing something moral. It shouldn't be controversial to say that right and wrong aren't found in how someone feels about what they are doing, and so this isn't an attempt to excuse anyone either.</p>
