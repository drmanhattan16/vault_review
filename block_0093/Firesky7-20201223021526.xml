  <title>/u/Firesky7 provides a peek into insider perspectives on oil spills</title>

    <div class="md">
      <p>I haven't had visibility to the insides of all of your examples, but I did have an internship at BP post-Deepwater Horizon where the stories and attitudes do not align with the flippant "it's priced in" attitude that you describe.</p>
      <p>The entire organization was terrified of another oil spill, saying multiple times that it almost bankrupted the company and forced them to sell off sections of the business (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARCO">Arco</a> gas stations have an incredibly wonky licensing structure as a result of this). While it's demonstrably possible for a company like BP to survive spills like Deepwater Horizon, they result in capital flows to completely unprofitable cleanup efforts, preventing investment in other wells and wrecking a lot of investment planning. In their estimation, BP was just starting to recover almost a decade later.</p>
