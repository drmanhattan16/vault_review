  <title>A personl take on the effects of MDMA</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <blockquote>
        <p>What does it feel like? </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>MDMA takes something like 30-45 minutes to hit you after taking it and the come up is very sudden. This leads to some funny situations like one time when the police showed up asking what we were doing right at the moment it was hitting me and a couple of others.</p>
      <p>You lose your inhibitions but in a different way than alcohol, instead of simply losing awareness like alcohol you're aware but just totally ok with doing stuff like giving people hugs and telling them how much you appreciate them. </p>
      <p>I feel like there's a big difference between taking it in a party setting and in a more intimate setting with friends. In a party setting it's sensory overload where the music just overrides everything else, you'll just be super happy and the experience is heightened when you know everyone else is feeling the same way. The ice is broken between everyone who is taking it and you can end up getting into a deep conversation with a group of strangers as if you're all already friends. </p>
      <p>In a quieter setting with friends you often get one person talking about their emotions or their life while the rest are genuinely interested enough to stand quietly and listen, only interrupting to say how much they've always appreciated you as a friend. People are always hugging or something but there's nothing sexual about it because it kills your sex drive (at least for guys). After the come up and plateau is over there's a relatively long comedown which is a much more chilled out kind of buzz.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>What were the negative effects? What is your judgement on risk v reward? </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I'm only basing this on personal observations as opposed to the actual science but making a habit out of it is something that happens quite often (not to me luckily), it's not a heavy addiction as people stop doing it so regularly after a while but it takes over some people's lives enough that they will for example fail that year of college and have try to get back on track once they clean up. Part of the negative effect is due to the fact that there's a drug culture where people will do some mixture of MDMA, coke, speed, ketamine, LSD every time they go to a party. I never felt an actual urge to go and take some so I assume your peer group has a lot to do with how habitual your use becomes.</p>
      <p>I know at least one person who ended up in hospital directly from taking it and a friend of mine always got some type of tonsillitis or Swine flu or something the day after so I assume it takes a toll on your immune system. This also never happened to me but a very common complaint is feeling very depressed for a few days afterwards.</p>
      <p>Doing a lot will leave you in as vulnerable a state as being very drunk but that usually only happens to the people who go way overboard and take 5 pills in a single night. Never happened to me or any of my friends but you can usually see a few students leaning up against a wall chewing their jaw off on a night out.</p>
      <p>Overall I think doing it once or twice can offer great improvements for people who are naturally more introverted or reserved. I did it about 10 times over 3 years and I have some great memories but the last time I did it I felt like I had gotten all I was going to get out of it so I just stopped.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>What were the effects?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The long term effects lasted about a year and amounted to being much more relaxed and ready to enjoy myself in social settings. I haven't done it in a couple of years now and I've gone back to being more reserved, but that's probably partly due to the fact that I've cut down a lot on drinking too.</p>
