  <title>Abandoning the Blue Tribe Faith, But Keeping Its Epistemology</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>There's a weird missing piece to the idea that you can't say anything anti-progressive on social media. You can, but just not to a group of educated yuppies that most of us count as our peer group. Like there's plenty of angry boomer facebook groups where you could hear that and more about the rioters, but joining them doesn't seem to be a serious option for most people. </p>
      <p>And I'm not playing coy. I get why, and all of the following applies to me on a deeply personal level: Many people here describe themselves as refugees from the blue tribe before it went crazy, but tribal affiliation runs deep, even deeper than politics. It's a shared culture, extending from language and self-presentation to cultural touchstones and how you were raised. To paraphrase <a href="/u/TracingWoodgrains">u/TracingWoodgrains</a> (who came up with my new favorite metaphor a few days ago) people here have abandoned the blue tribe faith but still have the blue tribe epistemology. The red tribe, however much they would agree with you about protests and riots, are using a totally different epistemology. </p>
      <p>It's not that people here think they're too <em>good</em> to talk shop with 60-year-old Jerry from Arkansas (although I think there's a tinge of that) but it would fundamentally be like trying to adapt on the fly as a newcomer to a foreign country; doable, but difficult. And since you're not just an immigrant but an exile, you'll always be thinking of what you left behind. People like me still want to be blue, on a subconscious level, even though our surface-level thoughts are trending red, and that causes a lot of cognitive dissonance.</p>
