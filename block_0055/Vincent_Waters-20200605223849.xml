  <title>The Archetypal Imagery of Dark Lord Trump and His Bible</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>The archetypal imagery implied by the story is extremely provocative, calling towards Moses parting the Red Sea, or Darth Vader effortlessly destroying all those in his path. </p>
      <p>Just imagine the tear gas canisters erupting, the protesters clear, smoke fills the area... But then, through the smoke appears a black automobile with thick tainted glass windows, making it impossible to see inside. The passenger is none other than the Dark Lord himself, Donald J. Trump! He gets out of the car. Someone approaches him and hands him a Bible. He mockingly holds the Bible upside down, up and away from his body, making his contempt clear for the world to see. He returns the Bible to the man who handed it to him and gets back in the black automobile. He leaves as promptly as he arrived.</p>
      <p>This is obviously a comic overstatement of what actually happened. But you have to admit, it would be a great scene in a movie.</p>
