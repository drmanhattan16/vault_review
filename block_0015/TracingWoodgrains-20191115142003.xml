        <p>What happens in Christianity when your own pastor is teaching you incorrect doctrine?</p>

      <p>Start a new denomination, just like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Smith">every</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellen_G._White">other</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther">person</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin">who</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad">felt</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emanuel_Swedenborg">their</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Taze_Russell">pastors</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Lee">were</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Baker_Eddy">teaching</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Knox">incorrect</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus">doctrine</a>. Or join one of the thousands of extant options.</p>
      <p>Your position feels rooted in the sort of modern Protestantism where every denomination of Christianity is all basically Christian, everyone who accepts Christ is going to Heaven, and whatever minor doctrinal disagreements everyone has can just sort of smooth out. Except for Jehovah's Witnesses, who believe wrong. And Mormons, who also believe wrong. And maybe Seventh Day Adventists, who believe wrong-ish. And maybe Catholics, who believe wrong but might be grandfathered in anyway, depending on who you ask. My own religious experience was a bit different. I've long ago lost count of the number of times I heard <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng">this story</a>:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>My mind at times was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were so great and incessant. The Presbyterians were most decided against the Baptists and Methodists, and used all the powers of both reason and sophistry to prove their errors, or, at least, to make the people think they were in error. On the other hand, the Baptists and Methodists in their turn were equally zealous in endeavoring to establish their own tenets and disprove all others.</p>
        <p>In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be aright, which is it, and how shall I know it?</p>

      <p>The history of Christianity is a history of schisms. Even the <em>schisms</em> have schisms. Take a look at <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6f/LDS_Denominations.png/1920px-LDS_Denominations.png">how many denominations exist within the latter-day saint movement alone</a>. Most of them I've barely even heard of, and I lived and breathed this stuff for years. Christianity's been changing all the time, with different branches rising up to meet different real or perceived needs, each one claiming to reform or restore something critical that's been lost. </p>
      <p>Heck, the tendency to schism extends far beyond Christianity itself. Ask the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith">Baha'i</a>, who could be described with startling accuracy as "Islamic-descended Mormons." That's a parallel for another time. The point is that "Everyone is practicing Christianity wrong" is an experience as old as Christianity itself. Given that Christ himself came along and called out the Pharisees and Sadducees for practicing a corrupted version of their own faith, I would say older, even. As old as religion itself.</p>
      <p>It can be interpreted in a faithful way or a cynical one. I choose the cynical take these days, but I wore the other hat long enough to know that it's possible to use widespread flaws in the beliefs of others as motivation to stay on an orthodox, faithful path.</p>
