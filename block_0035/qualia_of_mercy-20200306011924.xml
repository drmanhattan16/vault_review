  <title>Why Old White Guys Win In the Democratic Party</title>

    <div class="md">
      <p>Here's a theory how we got this seemingly counterintuitive result!</p>
      <p>The spread of social justice has led directly to heavy polarization and race/gender/class/age segregation of society. That in turn leads to fewer politicians with a national stature and cross-demographic appeal; a Latino candidate is going to be, fairly or unfairly, portrayed as the guy who will put Latinos first, and so forth. Therefore, the only people who can make it nationally are those who a) became prominent nationally before the age of social justice, and b) possess what is still considered to be a "generic" demographic not even worth mentioning. Thus: old white guys.</p>
      <p>Ya know, I think there might be something to this.</p>
