  <title>You Don't Need a Coyote to Enter the Red Tribe</title>

      <p>So rereading this made me kick things around a bit this might be word vomit but</p>
      <p>I’m sure not red tribe exists in the same way blue tribe does. I’m not sure there are rigid barriers. </p>
      <p>I grew up solidly blue tribe. And sorta started to drift. Anyway about a decade about early in my career my work sent me to rural Texas. And… I fit in ish? I mean no one excluded me or was rude to me. I had to turn down several invitations to church every week (including at the bar Saturday night) but people still treated me the same afterwards. Foxnews was more popular than CNN but there were people who watched CNN and I don’t think anyone would’ve excluded you from anything or thought it was weird if you’d mentioned that.</p>
      <p>The only live music was country. But no one reacted strangely when I mentioned I was driving a few hours to Houston for a hippy/electronic music festival thing. People were still social, invited me out etc, </p>
      <p>Now contrast that with the reaction you’d get if you told a blue tribe member you loved foxnews, country music, and asked them if they wanted to go hunting with you this weekend.</p>
