  <title>The Point of Rightwing Accelerationism</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>I don’t think you understand the point of right wing accelerationism.</p>
      <p>The point is to GET TO an American Hugo Chavez or Ideally an American Mao Zeitung... as quickly as possible.</p>
      <p>.</p>
      <p>The key is getting through the phases of revolutionary terror as fast as possible, so that by the time they start having mass executions in the streets of American cities they still haven’t disarmed or torn down red state institutions. In that scenario red tribe can merely load their mags declare independence and fight the inevitable decades long counter revolution.</p>
      <p>The worst case scenario is America continues as is and for the next 2 decades the Neutral/left-by-defaults feed more and more of our brightest and most curious into the communist maw, while working with said communists to assimilate and “educate” red tribe strongholds into disarming and weakening.</p>
      <p>If the revolution happens now red tribe strongholds are well positioned to make like Finland or Taiwan or Free poland and enjoy prosperous nationalist renaissances while the core imperial loyalists who have tormented them perish in the revolutionary conflagration they fuelled.</p>
      <p>However if things are allowed to progress and the alliance of Liberal and Communist continues then those Red strongholds will falter under the mounting pressures  and when the revolution finally comes they won’t get to escape like Finland but instead bear the full brunt of their enemies hatreds like Ukraine.</p>
      <p>.</p>
