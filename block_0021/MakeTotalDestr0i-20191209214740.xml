  <title>An Unknown Crisis</title>

      <p>The whole decade was sort of dull, but in global terms of an incredible impact, that cascaded into major global effects, in deaths, suffering, war, revolutions, and mass migration, that few in the USA seemed to have noticed because of their <strong>first-world availability bias</strong> was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010%E2%80%9312_world_food_price_crisis">2010–12 world food price crisis</a>.</p>
      <p>I want to point out that you rationalist types in general have a tendency to focus heavily on your pet risks like AI and other edge case X-risks but ignore the fragile dependency structures that everything rests upon which have a much higher (probablilty of occurence) X (magnitude of effect) value. </p>
      <p>The  2010–12 world food price crisis was absolutely brutal to the bottom socioeconomic 80% of the world population. When people are spending 30-50% of their income on food and food prices double or triple... well, you do the math.</p>
      <p>also see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_world_food_price_crisis">this</a> for longer explanation of the prior world food price crisis, since this is more detailed and largely applies to the 2010-2012 example as well.</p>
