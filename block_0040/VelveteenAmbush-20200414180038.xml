  <title>A Hot Take: Weinstein's Real Crime</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>Spicy hot take on Weinstein: his real crime -- the one that <em>actually</em> brought him down, not the one that was an open secret for decades -- was ruining our ability to enjoy the performances of actresses. Before, you could imagine that they succeeded on merit, whatever that means exactly in the space of acting. But after the Fappening, it became tough to avoid the impression that actresses are actually just whores with extra steps... and not many extra steps at that. Weinstein's sex-for-roles deal (and the same deal by other powerful men in Hollywood) was the causal engine that filled the social class of successful actresses with whores, and the Fappening was the event that made it hard to pretend otherwise. With that unpleasant knowledge -- of what it actually takes in the real world to succeed as an actress -- one can't view actresses as role models, one can't take social or political cues from them, watching them on the runway at the Oscars feels a lot less majestic, little girls lose their fantasy of becoming an actress, and it generally took a lot of the shine off of Hollywood.</p>
      <p>So, Hollywood actresses have probably always been whores, at least disproportionately... it isn't like Weinstein personally invented the producer's quid-pro-sex scheme... but Fappening stole our innocence, and we're out for revenge on the people responsible for stealing it.</p>
