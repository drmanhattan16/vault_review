  <title>The Remarkable Verbal Intelligence of Active Politicians</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>People don't realize how hard the job of a politician is. It's the equivalent of having "Speech 100" in videogames. For hours and hours a day, you have to respond to tough questions, which are often designed to trip you up. You can't hesitate, you can't repeat yourself, you can't stumble over words, you can't start a sentence over, and you have to make sure that no isolated snippet of your response can be taken out of context, which is a perverse requirement that even amazing writers have trouble with. And if you fail a single time all day, it's that slip that will be remembered.</p>
      <p>If you've never had the experience of going through a hostile interview where you need to obey all of these rules, you should try. It's very humbling. The day to day life of a politician functions as one of the most difficult verbal intelligence tests I've ever seen, and I bet that anybody who disagrees could be demolished by either Trump <em>or</em> Biden in a debate. They might not be as good as Romney or Obama, but they're both well into the 99th percentile.</p>
      <p>Anyway, that's why I think Biden's health is just fine.</p>
