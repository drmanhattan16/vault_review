  <title>The Tyranny of Meaningfulness</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>I was reading Chesterton's Utopia for Usurers, and he makes a really good point bout the tyranny behind this.:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"If the modern employer came to the conclusion, for some reason or other, that he could get most out of his men by working them only two hours a day, his whole mental attitude would still be foreign and hostile to holidays. For his whole mental attitude is that the passive time and the active time are useful for his business. All is, indeed, grist that comes to his mill, including the millers.  His slaves will serve him in unconsciousness, as dogs hunt in slumber."</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>There's sort of a tyranny of meaningfulness where recreation has to build you up as a person, and Chesterton nails the cause; its the capitalist system wanting productivity to infiltrate every area of life. A lot of "meaningful" recreation is seen as such because it is beneficial to capitalism more than it is intrinsically meaningful. It builds skills that makes you a better worker, or it reinforces the capitalist consumer ideology and class status. </p>
      <p>Why do you want to learn a new skill? A lot of times to be more marketable.</p>
      <p>Why creative? Maybe you can monetize it, or make it into a side hustle.</p>
      <p>Why do you want to increase your social circle? network, network, network.</p>
      <p>Why is it healthy recreation instead of sedentary? Better bodies mean better workers.</p>
      <p>I know not everyone always approaches it like this, but the knowledge class seems very vulnerable to meaningful recreation as a weapon to make them better capitalists. The cult of productivity demanding more and more of life.</p>
