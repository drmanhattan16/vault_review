  <title>Low-Level Fears of an Accurate Conspiracy</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>One of my low level worries is that there would be one day something go very wrong with some thing like 5G (likely not 5G itself but some other technological marvel, no idea which one of course) and it would be impossible to discuss it for decades until it kills or maims enough people that it would be completely impossible to deny - something Thalidomide-level or worse. And it'd happen because anybody showing early indications about something wrong would be immediately painted as "conspirologist" and excluded from discussion, which would justifiably piss them off and make them sound a lot like what crazy conspirologists sound like, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis">cascade is inevitable</a>.</p>
