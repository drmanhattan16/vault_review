  <title>Scalpers and Defection Against Implicit Compacts</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>I think it makes more sense if you treat the low price of hand sanitizer in the shop as an act of charity or subsidy¹ running on an implicit premise of "take only as much as you need." This implicit compact is what the scalper is defecting against.</p>
      <p>¹ Ie. it's a subsidy that's meant to be demand-side/per-person, but is handled supply-side because that's just easier.</p>
      <p>I think part of the disconnect is that some people perceive this compact, almost viscerally so, and some people almost don't at all; and to the people perceiving it, the people not perceiving it read as "outlaws", because they can't relate to that blindless; to them, they're people who perceive the compact but choose to defect anyways, for personal gain, in a time of crisis. Like, it's not difficult to understand why this would draw extreme anger even at an abstract level - they're robbing the collection box.</p>
