  <title>The Desire to Be Forced Away From Your Own Hedonistic Urges</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>I think what these guys want is not necessarily to live those lives, but to live surrounded by other people who live those lives. They recognize and deeply feel that they themselves and their own culture is disgusting and self-destructive, but also they're too weak to do anything about it.</p>
      <p>I think what they actually want is for someone to bust into their apartment, punch them in the face, and <em>force them</em> against their own self-destructive, hedonistic urges to improve themselves so they won't feel so disgusted with themselves. They want to be told what to do. They just want to be told what to do by someone who is at least better than themselves.</p>
      <p>They don't want to be told what to do by the woke crowd. In the woke, they see all the worst aspects of themselves elevated to virtues. They see a culture that embodies evil itself. They hate it and want to destroy it, but are too weak to do so on their own. So they pray for someone to come do it for them, or to help motivate them to do it themselves.</p>
      <p>And I think that woke culture looks so evil to many people, that if legitimate fascists came along, and they said outright that they were going to do all this other evil shit, but they would be destroying woke culture in the process, those fascists might well be seen as the lesser evil. At least they're not <em>your</em> evil. When the fascists do something horrible, you don't feel it in your soul. It's not an attack on your ego. They don't really represent <em>you</em>.</p>
