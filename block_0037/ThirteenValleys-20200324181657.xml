  <title>The Origin of Boomer-Hate</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>One theory I saw on Tumblr (might have been kontextmaschine or balioc) to explain both the depths of hatred that some young people feel towards Boomers and the fact that a large subset of Boomers seems to be invisible: </p>
      <p>When people say "Boomer", they're not talking about ex-miners or farmers or factory workers who haven't had steady work since the mine/farm/factory closed in 1987. They're talking about people who were born into middle-class or higher families in the suburbs, went to college, got a white-collar or creative job, racked up income via pensions and investments, and retired with a wealth of assets. That's not a large group of people all things considered. But it's the group that millennials from the same background saw becoming as their birthright. <em>They</em> went to good schools, <em>they</em> got liberal arts degrees, so where's <em>their</em> well-paying creative-field job? Hence the special venom, and the studied ignoring of whoever doesn't fit the 'rich spoiled Boomer' archetype.</p>
