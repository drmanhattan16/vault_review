  <title>Cleaving Apart Tolerance and Normalcy</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>I think it might be useful to distinguish the concepts of 'tolerance' and 'normalcy' as axes upon which the main sides in this culture war differ. At the risk of strawmanning certain positions I think stating some differing views on the relationship between tolerance and normalcy and their associated supporters will be a good way of illustrating the differences here:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tolerance ends at the limits of normalcy</strong>: This is the non-liberal social conservative (as opposed to socially conservative liberal) view in which that which is outside the prevailing (often religiously informed) norms should not be tolerated. Toleration and normalcy are not distinct and so deviation is always a problem. Ideally the state would codify these attitudes but non-liberal social conservatives are so small a group these days that they usually have to accept living under a liberal system.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tolerance and normalcy are entirely separable.</strong> This is the traditionally liberal view. People of differing racial or religious groups, people of different sexual orientations etc can coexist as long as certain ground rules of non-discrimination are respected. What is considered normal is not important unless it is causing people to infringe on the freedoms of others, and so no specific makeup e.g 90% Christian and 10% Atheist or vice versa is problematic as long as the ground rules are obeyed. Mere intolerant attitudes don't meet the bar for the type of intolerance the state should be concerned with.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tolerance is at risk if it is not supported by normalisation.</strong> This is more along the lines of the modern progressive view but you can find possible cases of it among conservatives too. The liberal ground rules would still allow the 90% majority to hold negative attitudes towards the 10% minority, and this means that while the minority group may be safe for now their liberty is ultimately subject only to the self-restraint of the majority. This is not a desirable positon to be in and since there is no higher authority that could step in to save them if the 90% do decide to throw away the liberal compact of tolerance this means that the 10% exist in a precarious situation. The solution is to proactively change the opinions of the 90% so that new normals are established and the risk of them being the target of an intolerant 90% goes down. Conservative gun rights activists also pursue a strategy of normalisation by open carrying, bringing their weapons to protests etc, though it's a bit harder to see how this fact fits into the same category. They might agree that if guns stop being considered normal their rights will be more at risk but they probably don't pursue normalisation as strongly on account of all their guns, which limit the harm an intolerant majority could really do to them.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Some thoughts:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>(i) The non-liberal social conservative who lives in a liberal state is in a sense already experiencing a similar kind of anxiety as the progressive insofar as they are not permitted to self-segregate from the rest of society. Attempts at normalisation are to this group experienced as encroachments upon their way of life, similar to how some progressives feel the norms of the majority encroaching upon their way of life. A pluralistic liberalism that takes the group as the unit of concern should have no problem allowing certain groups to self-segregate as far as they want, but a pluralistic liberalism that takes the individual as the unit of concern might feel the need to interfere with the group to ensure that for example children and defectors are secured a real liberty to exit the group if they decide to.</p>
      <p>(ii) The progressive anxiety at their position may be a result of a loss of faith in the authority of liberalism. Being to a large extent composed of an alliance of minority groups the progressives get a pretty good deal under liberalism, but if liberalism looks like it's on its last legs then it makes sense that there would be an impetus to secure their place in a post-liberal world by making sure they fall on the right side of normal in a more intolerant world.</p>
      <p>(iii) Both progressives and some social conservatives (both liberal and non-liberal conservatives) seem believe that when the area of normalcy shrinks the area of toleration will soon follow. This might be why "the War on Christmas" was a thing. It could unfortunately be the case that increased normalisation of one thing means decreased normalisation of another thing and so conflict is inevitable.</p>
