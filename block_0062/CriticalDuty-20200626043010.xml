  <title>Blackpilling on the United Methodist Church</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>The United Methodist Church loses a thousand members every week. I don't know if you've been following the big stories in Methodism of late, but at the 2019 Methodist General Conference, a progressive coalition tried to pass a plan to allow homosexual marriages in Methodist churches, but were voted down by a conservative coalition that supported a ban on gay marriage and penalties for clergymen who performed gay marriages. The divide was both ideological as well as racial; a lot of white progressives on one side, and a lot of black conservatives from the African denominations on the other side. </p>
      <p>The UMC's response to this defeat was to negotiate a split within the church, giving the African denominations millions of dollars to leave the UMC and start their own denomination. The reason for this was simple numerical fear; the stagnancy of liberal Methodism in America and the explosive growth of conservative Methodism in Africa meant that the liberals would always be overruled by the African denominations unless they deliberately engineered a schism that would allow them to retain some power. That makes the UMC the model example of the Blue Tribe church, if you ask me - an organization that literally severed its connection to its fastest-growing congregations in order to appeal to people who don't even go to church.</p>
