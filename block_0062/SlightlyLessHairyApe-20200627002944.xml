  <title>Extending the Standards of Our Time to the Villians</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>So I had a small thought brought about by the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMotte/comments/hdlwx8/culture_war_roundup_for_the_week_of_june_22_2020/fw3t8ug/">Solanas</a> thing. </p>
      <p>Different parts of the CW have a different relationship with the evils of the past and the propriety of judging historical figures by contemporary ethical standards. And so on about "Jefferson owned slaves" or "Lincoln spoke against racial equality" and so forth. That's been trod to death, and so that's not what this thread is about. This thread is about how we judge the people driven to madness by those historical inequities. It's about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brown_(abolitionist)">John Brown</a>, and maybe (perhaps, counterfactually anyway) Solanas. </p>
      <p>Because it's one thing to say that we ought not judge the racial opinions of 1858 or the homophobic vibe of 1958 by the standards of 2020, but it raises the question of how we perceive an abolitionist or a lesbian who grew up in those times. Surely both Solanas and Brown ended up driven to madness and evil, and ultimately moral responsibility lies with them. If I'm honest with myself though, were it me growing up as smart woman in the 50s whose career opportunities were artificially limited, whose sexual orientation was hardly recognized, I don't know that I wouldn't end up on that same dark path. </p>
      <p>There's some kind of reckoning we have to conceive here. And if we are going to allow that the heroes in the past be judged by the standards of their time, it only seems fair that we should extend that same benefit to the villains.</p>
