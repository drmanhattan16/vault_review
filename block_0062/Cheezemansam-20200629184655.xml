  <title>The Role of Precedent in the Supreme Court</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>Note: <em>Stare Decisis</em> is the legal principle of determining points in litigation according to precedent. This is a controversial topic because there is disagreement about <em>precisely</em> how to apply precedent, as well as how much deference the court out to give to "bad" precedents.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>SCOTUS has struck down a Louisiana regulation requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The outcome is emblamatic of what some conservatives see as the judicial equivalent of Lucy pulling away the football.</p>

      <p>I don't really like this level of CW framing. The Supreme Court is probably the only institution that is bound by law to give very explicit and specific arguments for the decisions they make, so at the very least <em>criticism</em> should center around these arguments, rather than the meta-level commentary of "Judge X betrayed their team because he reached a different conclusion". At least, that is the discussion we see literally everywhere else.</p>
      <p>I think it would be better to frame it more in terms of the substantive disagreement. As mentioned, the dissent does focus on feeling that it is a bad law, and historically Justice Thomas is perfectly eager to overturn bad precedent. Thomas doesn’t really care about precedent at all. The rationale being that a wrong decision that is allowed to stand is still a wrong decision and may be incompatible with the way he sees the legal system as functioning harmoniously. On the other side, Roberts, Breyer, and Kagan all give much more weight to stare decisis because of a number of reasons, including a desire to have predictability in the law and, for Roberts especially, making sure the court is seen as apolitical.</p>
      <p>In terms of "Keep or overrule objectionable [bad?] precedent?"</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Factors in favor of keeping old precedents intact:</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Statutory precedents generally stay put, even if wrongly decided, based on the relative ease by which Congress can fix a bad SCOTUS decision, especially if Congress has amended the statute at issue and not addressed the purported bad SCOTUS decision. See Kimble v. Marvel Entertainment (2015).</li>
        <li>Reliance interests make justices reluctant to overturn cases. Practically and pragmatically speaking, when private individuals or businesses enter into long term business relationships, or buy and sell property, or make lasting life decisions based on settled law, SCOTUS is very reluctant to revisit those foundations. Planned Parenthood v. Casey goes into an extensive discussion about how difficult it is to measure reliance interests, in how people have "organized intimate relationships and made choices that define their views of themselves and their places in society, in reliance on the availability of abortion in the event that contraception should fail," and recognizing that the difficulty of quantifying that reliance doesn't mean that it isn't significant. Even public/governmental entities that have enacted procedures based on SCOTUS rulings are entitled to some stability. That's why SCOTUS didn't overturn Miranda in Dickerson v. U.S. (2000), despite using some language that really called into question the validity of the reasoning in Miranda. After all, pretty much every police department has Miranda warnings ingrained in their procedures, so that overturning Miranda would probably be pretty disruptive.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Factors that favor overturning old precedent:</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Impracticability or unworkability. Nearly a century of judicial experience with the forum shopping gamesmanship under Swift v. Tyson, persuaded SCOTUS to overturn Swift with Erie, 9-0. Similarly, SCOTUS continually tweaking the "categorical approach" with the Armed Career Criminal Act's "residual clause," with Courts of Appeals struggling to actually follow SCOTUS's broad and general guidance, eventually led SCOTUS to rule that the residual clause was unconstitutionally vague, and therefore void, in Johnson v. United States (2015).</li>
        <li>A history of warnings showing the problems with the original analysis, and maturing case law circling around the case to be overturned. Johnson and the ACCA falls within this category, where a few cases before Johnson called the whole structure into question, inviting lower courts and litigants to really explore the limits of the arguments against the constitutionality. Brown v. Board didn't come out of nowhere, because there were decades upon decades of SCOTUS cases affirming the general principle of Plessy's "separate but equal," but in each case deciding that the particular segregation scheme before the court was not actually "equal." Those cases laid the foundation for the ultimate conclusion that "separate" was inherently not "equal," and that "separate but equal" was a contradiction in terms.</li>
        <li>Factual foundations or predictions in judicial opinions that have since been disproven. Lochner seemed to be premised on the idea that unrestricted freedom to contract would provide for the the bare minimum of human needs without government intervention, but the Great Depression showed that larger economic forces could overtake individual contracts in such a way that justices were uncomfortable with the implications that would flow from that earlier decision, and was ultimately overturned. Brown also showed the long term untenability of the "separate but equal" fiction, in light of actual facts that strongly suggested that black citizens were denied the same opportunities as white citizens.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>There are arguments on both sides for whether these factors weigh in favor of overturning Roe, so it's not super predictive on deciding whether a particular justice will actually rule to apply the rule of a case that they dissented from, but it looks like Roberts did exactly that today.</p>
      <p>Also, there are other very substantial points of disagreement provided by the dissent, one is that several central facts are different from the precedent [Page 90]:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Stare decisis is a major theme in the plurality opinion and
that of THE CHIEF JUSTICE. Both opinions try to create the
impression that this case is the same as Whole Woman’s
Health and that stare decisis therefore commands the same
result. In truth, however, the two cases are very different.
While it is certainly true that the Texas and Louisiana statutes are largely the same, the two cases are not. The decision in Whole Woman’s Health was not based on the face of
the Texas statute, but on an empirical question, namely,
the effect of the statute on access to abortion in that State.
579 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 24). The Court’s answer to that
question depended on numerous factors that may differ
from State to State, including the demand for abortions, the 
number and location of abortion clinics and physicians, the
geography of the State, the distribution of the population,
and the ability of physicians to obtain admitting privileges.
Id., at <strong><em>–</em></strong> (slip op., at 24–26). There is no reason to
think that a law requiring admitting privileges will necessarily have the same effect in every state. As a result, just
because the Texas admitting privileges requirement was
found by this Court, based on evidence in the record of that
case, to have substantially reduced access to abortion in
that State, it does not follow that Act 620 would have comparable effects in Louisiana. See id., at <strong><em>–</em></strong> (slip op., at
22–26) (reviewing Texas record). The two States are neighbors, but they are not the same. Accordingly, the recordbased empirical determination in Whole Woman’s Health is
not controlling here.</p>
        <p>The suggestion that Whole Woman’s Health is materially
identical to this case is ironic, since the two cases differ in
a way that was critical to the Court’s reasoning in Whole
Woman’s Health, i.e., the difference between a pre-enforcement
facial challenge and a post-enforcement challenge based on
evidence of the law’s effects. See id., at ___ (slip op., at 11).
Before the Texas law went into effect, abortion providers
mounted an unsuccessful facial challenge, arguing that the
law would drastically limit abortion access. The Fifth Circuit held that the plaintiffs had not shown that the law
would create a substantial obstacle for women seeking
abortions, and a final judgment was entered against them.
Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs.
v. Abbott, 748 F. 3d 583, 590, 605 (2014). Then, after the
law had been in operation for some time, many of the same
plaintiffs filed a second suit and again argued that the admitting privileges requirement violated Casey. Whole
Woman’s Health v. Cole, 790 F. 3d 563, 577, and n. 14 (CA5
2015). The State defendants sought dismissal based on the
doctrine of claim preclusion, but the Whole Woman’s Health
majority rejected that argument</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>And also that, again unlike the Texas law, there is not actually evidence in support of the "harms women" (very roughly put) theory [Page 92]:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Aside from suggesting that Whole Woman’s Health is dispositive, the plurality and THE CHIEF JUSTICE provide one
other reason for concluding that Act 620, if allowed to go
into effect, would create a substantial obstacle for women
seeking abortions. Pointing to the District Court’s finding
that the Louisiana law would have a drastic effect on abortion access, June Medical Services, LLC v. Kliebert, 250
F. Supp. 3d 27, 87 (MD La. 2017), the plurality and THE
CHIEF JUSTICE note that findings of fact may be overturned
only if clearly erroneous, and they see no such error here.
Ante, at 17 (opinion of BREYER, J.); ante, at 15–16 (opinion
of ROBERTS, C. J.). In taking this approach, they overlook
the flawed legal standard on which the District Court’s finding depends, and they ignore the gross deficiencies of the
evidence in the record.</p>
