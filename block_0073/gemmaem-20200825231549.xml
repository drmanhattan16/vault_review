  <title>Safe Spaces as a Safety Valve</title>

      <blockquote>
        <p>While I should be more reluctant to tie something together that's not explicitly cited, but given the <em>extreme</em> popularity of Kendi and DiAngelo, I think it is reasonable to read it as "every, to a greater or lesser degree" rather than "a noticeable but not necessarily numerous 'enough.'"</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I would like to note, as a matter of fact that you yourself may already be noticing, that you're being uncharitable.</p>
      <p>I've been around here long enough to know that argumentative charity can be tiring, and that it will betray you, and that sometimes the person you give it to won't even want it. Still, I think it is always worth noting places where you <em>could</em> have been more charitable, even if you then mindfully choose not to.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Though the more interesting point has largely been glossed over: this is an admission, albeit from a small and hopefully non-representative group, that pluralistic society is basically impossible because perfection is impossible. Not <em>everyone</em> can be made utterly obsequious and perfectly 'educated,' so instead Segregation Now, Segregation Forever (hopefully this is by choice, though, and Black students can opt out of being self-segregated).</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I've been in a lot of women-only spaces, over the years. Some of them felt like completely unnecessary segregation, marking women out as 'different' when we really weren't, in that context, different in any meaningful sense. Others of them felt silly and ineffectual, like, yes, it's tricky being a woman around here, but I don't really feel any more supported when surrounded by women than I do in the general (90% male or whatever) population.</p>
      <p>But some of those spaces felt good, and useful. They were places to relax a guard that I might not otherwise have even realised I was holding. Places where I could obliquely reference the shit I'd been through and be a bit less worried that it would prejudice people against me. Places where I could coo over other people's baby pictures without fearing that my colleagues would see me as frivolous. Places where women who I respected could admit to feeling incompetent sometimes, even though they definitely weren't.</p>
      <p>I don't think all men are sexist. There are probably even men who could be in that space with us, and it would still be a safe and welcoming space (although the bar for that is higher than just not being sexist). But if we didn't mark the space as being "for women," well, it wouldn't do those things. It just wouldn't.</p>
      <p>The proposal isn't actually asking for rigid segregation. For one thing, as you note, black students are definitely allowed to opt out of this. For another thing, this would just be one space among many. Classrooms would still be integrated, as would most social events.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>African American students, the group states, desperately require a “safe space” where they can escape from students, staff and faculty of other races.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I know there's an interpretation of "safe space" where it means "a space you escape into and never come out of." But many of the best safe spaces are not expansionist, and you're not meant to spend <em>all</em> of your time there. They can be a safety valve, not a way of life. It sounds to me like that's what this proposal is describing.</p>
