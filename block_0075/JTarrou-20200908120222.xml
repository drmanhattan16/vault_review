  <title>The Cyclical Misery of War</title>

      <p>Just a marker, I don't find the predictions of civil war particularly convincing. I don't think we're anywhere near it, and I dearly hope it never happens. I've been to war, a few times, and there is nothing about it that any armchair bullshitter in a first world country wants, in reality. It is the worst thing people do to each other, mostly because it forces one to become less human just to survive, and much worse than human to win. </p>
      <p>â€‹</p>
      <p>But, if I'm wrong, it will be because people have become so removed from violence and its consequences that they lose all touch with reality and start a war for fun, as it were. There was an aspect to this in several past wars, the USCW and WW1 especially. Too much peace convinces people that war isn't that bad, and then they fuck around and find out. Then they over-correct and start appeasing the worst demagogues in a fruitless search for peace. Such is human nature.</p>
