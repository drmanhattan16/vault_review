  <title>The Great Attention-Management Trick of Democracy</title>

      <p>Well, the vast majority of them probably both voted for those who were. I've spoken about the great attention-management trick of democracy before - the soldier shoots a Muslim and says it's not their fault because their commander ordered them to, the commander in question says it's not their fault because their superior ordered them to, and so on, until you reach the President or whoever sets military policy, who then says it's not their fault because the voters wanted them to, but then the voters all say that they just voted and didn't author foreign policy and by the way you are being evil and anti-democratic by even implying that they ought to be personally punished for their vote, which basically amounts to forcing them to vote in a particular way. With power comes responsibility; you can't simultaneously say that the US is morally superior because it is a democracy where the people are sovereign but then say that the same people bear no moral responsibility for the government's actions.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the WTC specifically probably housed one of the highest concentration of direct beneficiaries of the exact policies that inspired AQ's suicidal rage, since the "world trade" part presumably describes the act of pushing around money within the globalised US-centered trade network that the US has been assimilating reticent societies into at gunpoint, with dramatic consequences for their cultural conservatives.</p>
