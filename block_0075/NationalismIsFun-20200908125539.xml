  <title>War Isn't That Bad</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>I have been in wars before they’re not that bad. They’re senseless and terrible and of course it’s nice to have a not-war place to come home to but you can kind of shrug and say “it’s war” and in my experience real life is much harder to deal with than war.</p>
      <p>I have a buddy who was supposed to pick up his dad from the airport on Christmas Day but they got in a fight about something stupid so he told him he “forgot.” His Dad’s Uber driver had been working too long, fell asleep, crashed, and so last thing he ever told his dad was “fuck you” and a stupid lie.</p>
      <p>I have a buddy who took his daughter to a water park and she got some kind of disease they never did find out what but she died a couple days later and so did another couple kids who’d been to that park</p>
      <p>I have a buddy who slipped getting out of the shower a month before his wedding and his fiancé found him dead </p>
      <p>I guess my point is that in war the terrible senseless things are at least happening for a reason so you can kind of shrug it off. I wouldn’t root for it but I wouldn’t stress about it. Worse case scenario we die and as far as we know nobody minds being dead</p>
