  <title>Monogamy is a Social Construct, but So What?</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>The thing that annoys people about polyamory isn't that non-monogamous societies exist - everyone is implicitly aware of this, <em>a structure</em> that governs long-term sexual relationships is one of <em>the</em> core social constructs/base institutions along with religion, government and trade that exists in every complex society. There have been and are polygamous and other non-monogamous human societies in the world and most people are aware of this ("Arabs/Mormons have four wives" or whatever.)</p>
      <p>What annoys people is that "polyamory" tries to reflect back some of the <em>unique</em> aspects of the affluent, western, 20th century-onward monogamous social construct - like the modern notion of marital partnership and hybrid romantic/sexual love between two partners in an organised union - <em>back</em> onto a more primitive, largely sex-focused tribal relationship where Grug and Grugette like fucking as many other Grugs as possible while also sometimes having the sax with each other. </p>
      <p>Yes, monogamy is a social construct you <em>can</em> break free of. So is wearing clothes in hot weather. So is showering. What's your point?</p>
