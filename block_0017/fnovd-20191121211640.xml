  <title>The Sea of Information</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>Our efforts to master the internet are comparable to colonial efforts to master the sea. This level of human-to-human connection across great distances was previously unprecedented and there will be new power dynamics resulting from emergent systems we couldn't have imagined existing.</p>
      <p>We are basically information mercantilists in a world moving towards a free market of information. We want to maximize good information and minimize bad information. We have a simplistic understanding of information flow, because for most of our history, "good" information started at the top and was passed down by each level according to how beneficial its propagation would be to information authorities. The internet turned that on its head, and even though we retain as a society the feeling that "good" information comes from trusted experts, it's no longer as obvious who those experts are or what credentials even make one an expert. If we only focus on results, we bias toward the loud, spurious, and lucky, but if we focus only on alignment with understood principles then we calcify our blindspots.</p>
      <p>A free market of information means we no longer have the bouillon of "objective" established truths to use as a lodestar, as information has different value to different people. I don't know what that means for our society long-term. My instincts are that a bit of information being true or false will become less relevant than the contextual metadata surrounding the information. "This was published in a book" used to be all you needed to know that the information conformed to certain standards and endured some level of third-party scrutiny. To be fair, we've had alternatives sources of information like magazines, newsletters, mailing lists, etc. for a while but not to the degree we have now with Twitter, the chans et al.</p>
      <p>We're scaling up to take in all sorts information from hundreds or thousands of channels instead of just picking a few that we consider "right" and accepting everything they say. The sources of our information are important, but meta-trends between channels become much more significant that any individual exemplar.</p>
