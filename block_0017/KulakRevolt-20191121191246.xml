  <title>The Internet as A Mirror</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>You see I think this is why I like the Internet as it developed and I think it delivered on its promise:</p>
      <p>I really enjoy things that do what they do perfectly and literally, such that they turn into a kind-of Monkey’s Paw and ultimate judge if their users character.</p>
      <p>Power tools, Kitchen tools, cars, GUNS. There’s something special about them that they do their job whether or not its a good idea in this particular instance or whether or not the user isn’t a idiot who should have realized they shouldn’t trust themselves with it.</p>
      <p>You put a gun or car or chainsaw in some peoples hands and they reveal a maturity or capability beyond themselves and some reveal an utter lack of character.</p>
      <p>The internet has really functioned in this mirror-like way: in some people it revealed incredible creativity, whimsy, curiosity and judgement.... and in others it revealed their neuroses, cruelty, pettiness and vices.</p>
      <p>I mean if you look at the internet and you hate it...well you are really looking at yourself.</p>
