        <p>At this point I donâ€™t understand what people think the internet has failed to deliver.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I have a theory.</p>
      <p>I think we believed that the Internet would distribute information to everyone. We'd have entire worlds at our fingertips, all the knowledge anyone could want. And this would finally make us all intellectually equal: brought up to the levels of elites, for the first time in history.</p>
      <p>And they were almost right.</p>
      <p>The Internet has distributed information to everyone. We have entire worlds at our fingertips, all the knowledge anyone would want. And in many levels, we're now intellectually equal . . .</p>
      <p>. . . because it turned out the elites had no clothes. They were just human. They were just <em>us</em>.</p>
      <p>The Internet didn't make us better. It destroyed the illusion of "better". It showed us there was no easy path, there was no free lunch, that we all have to do the hard work of <em>getting</em> better and that there was no elite caste of intellectual brilliance that we could model ourselves after.</p>
      <p>That the people we thought were leading us through the jungle were just as lost and incompetent as we were.</p>
      <p>So now everyone's trying to beat their own path through the jungle, and a lot of people are being devoured by lions, and this was always the case and lots of people were always being devoured by lions, but at least back then we could say that this was simply because they weren't following the right leaders, and now the concept of leadership is dead but the lions are still very real and it's actually all rather terrifying.</p>
