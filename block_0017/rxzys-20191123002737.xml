  <title>Reimagining the Role of Testing and Teachers</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>The average American cares much more about sports than academics, and yet, coaches manage to deal with this all the time.  No parent ever thinks their child committed a foul, everyone thinks their kid should start, etc.  Sports deals with this by having independent judges and referees run competitions.  The same would be very easy for schools, and moving teachers from judges, who grade students and decide how they are doing, to coaches who try their best to get the student the highest grade possible, would be a major win, in my opinion.  </p>
      <p>I would like to move to a system there teachers did not fail students, rather they did their best to help the student, but the student failed the independent test.  Having the teacher and student be on the same side had major advantages.  The American system, where teachers act primarily as gatekeepers, is strange to me, as it seems the incentives are in the wrong direction.</p>
