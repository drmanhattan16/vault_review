  <title>Freeing Government Cheese From Cheese Caves</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>Subsidies had accidentally incited dairy overproduction which threatened to bankrupt many dairy farmers and since the federal government had an interest in food autarky they bought a lot of that excess milk. That milk was stored in cheese form and stored in cheese caves. This government cheese  was given to people on food stamps, welfare, social security and food banks. It tasted good and melted well. Reagan set the cheese free because it wasnâ€™t being distributed efficiently and sat in its cheese caves, not being eaten and enjoyed. Freeing the cheese from its cheese caves was widely celebrated.</p>
