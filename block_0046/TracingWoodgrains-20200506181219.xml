  <title>A Moderation Policy that Would Ban Biden</title>

        <p>Any moderation policy that would ban major politicians (excluding Trump, because he is an outlier) is a very aggressive policy.</p>

      <p>I don't have a problem with that. I expect our moderation policy would lead to warnings or bans for lots of prominent figures with large platforms if they came here and acted/spoke the way they do on their platforms. That's by design, and is, I suspect, a big part of what leads the people who post here to do so. In an broader political atmosphere of increasing polarization and heated disagreement, my expectation is that most public figures <em>aren't</em> aiming to "move past shady thinking and test their ideas in a court of people who don't all share the same biases," and would have to adjust their approach for an atmosphere like this.</p>
