  <title>How It Feels To Walk Around Town With a Little Baby</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>I dunno, does #Blessed mom really <em>feel</em> blessed? One thing I was not prepared for having kids was how utterly amazing it was to walk around town with a little baby. I consider myself a pretty successful person, but absolutely nothing I've ever done in my life came remotely close to the positive attention of having a baby. No fancy car or diamond necklace can turn heads like a cute six-week-old. Total strangers literally <em>burst into tears</em> in Trader Joe's and told me wistfully about their own grown kids. Nothing has ever made me feel closer to people, or like the world is somehow, fundamentally, a good place like the way it reacted to my newborn. And I have a pretty privileged life overall; if you don't, that feeling must be like mainlining heroin.</p>
