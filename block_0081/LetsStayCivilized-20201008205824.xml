  <title>Concentric Circles of "White Supremacy"</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>I see it as three concentric circles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A: <em>Actual</em> self-proclaimed white supremacists who want an ethnostate, freak out about miscegenation, wear swastika tattoos etc. - probably a rounding error in terms of numbers, probably have as much political clout as the average knitting club, but can still cause problem with lone wolf attacks (the Christchurch guy etc.). This would include skinheads, /pol/tards, etc.</li>
        <li>B: Militant Right-wingers who aren't white supremacists (heck they may not even all be white), but don't really care about what the liberals think of them. Proud Boys, Boogaloo Boys and the like. Much more numerous, and only considered radioactive by the left.</li>
        <li>C: Whatever is causing black people to have problems in the US - the police ? structural racism ? just the fact that whites own more wealth ? By twisting definitions enough, one can call all of that (and more !) "white supremacy"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tied together, these paint a story where there are vast numbers (B) of crazy racists (A) that keep the black man down (C), whereas actually group B is not racist nor influential enough to have a significant effect on black people (those are mostly working class people, not captains of industry), group A is small and powerless (with the occasional attempt at terrorism), and the causes of C are way more varied and complex.</p>
