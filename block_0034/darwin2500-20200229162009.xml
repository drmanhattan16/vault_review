  <title>The Capitalist Message Of Bee Movie</title>
  <body>
    <div class="md">
      <p>I think maybe Bee Movie?</p>
      <p>The whole movie starts off with the main character trying to end the exploitation of his people's labor at the hands of beekeepers in an essentially anti-capitalist revolution.  </p>
      <p>
        <strong>However</strong>, as soon as he succeeds, the movie is quick to show all the bees miserably out of work, and the natural world falling apart as they stop pollinating flowers and so forth.  This is summarized most poignantly in a scene where the main character is trying to celebrate the victory of their emancipation with his best friend, but his friend is just depressed about losing his job, which gave his life meaning and purpose even if he was being exploited.</p>
      <p>The culmination is the bees going back to work for the humans but with marginally more rights an stake-holding in the use of their labor, with 'Bee Approved' labels stuck on honey bottles, but the essential capitalist system remaining intact and proven to be both essential and morally good.</p>
